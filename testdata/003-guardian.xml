      <title>Gordon Brown heralds progress at G20 financial crisis talks</title>

The prime minister is pushing the idea of immediate and coordinated tax cuts – as well interest rate cuts - to prevent the global economy &lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/recession"&gt;sliding deeper into recession&lt;/a&gt;. The prime minister has argued that interest rate cuts alone are insufficient to stave off a slump and that the impact of tax cuts or higher public spending will be diluted if carried out by only a handful of countries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The US president, George Bush, agreed that progress had been made but said the crisis has not ended and much work needs to be done. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a radio address, the US president-elect, &lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/barackobama"&gt;Barack Obama&lt;/a&gt;, said he was pleased that George Bush had brought world leaders to Washington to discuss turmoil in the financial markets "because our global economic crisis requires a coordinated global response".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Washington summit, meant to be the first in a series, was arranged to discuss steps to deal with what policymakers describe as the worst economic crisis since the Great Depression in the 1930s. US retailers reported a record fall in sales last month and the chairman of the Federal Reserve, Ben Bernanke, hinted at another interest rate cut to encourage consumers to spend.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But even as world leaders met in what is the largest collection of presidents and prime ministers in almost a decade, doubts were raised that it would achieve anything beyond immediate moves to stimulate the world economy and an agreement to meet again.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Economists warned that hopes of a major push on creating new global regulatory systems would almost certainly be dashed. The meeting had been too hastily convened, was riven by too many internal contradictions and was too hampered by the power vacuum in Washington to achieve instant results. "I'm confident that not much concrete action will come out of it," said Brad Setser, a former US Treasury official and expert on geoeconomics at the Council on Foreign Relations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The fact that the gathering brings together representatives of about 85% of the world's economy has prompted inevitable comparisons to the 1944 Bretton Woods meeting when 44 countries gathered in New Hampshire to devise the postwar international monetary system. But most analysts believe that "Bretton Woods II" will resemble its predecessor only in the scale of the crisis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With US unemployment at its highest level in 25 years, the eurozone in recession and Chinese growth slowing, the challenges confronting the global economy are daunting. But the expectations are limited for what will emerge from five hours of discussions. Two years of work went into the original Bretton Woods, compared with a month of scrambled preparations for this summit. "There hasn't been enough preparatory work for this summit to come up with any systemic recommendations," said Dani Rodrik, a professor of economics at Harvard University.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Brown acknowledged disputes over how, and how fast, to reform international financial institutions such as the IMF and World Bank. "There are very different points of view about what should be done, different interests represented here, different policy positions," he said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the prime minister added that today's talks could see a breakthrough in the long-running &lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/dohatradetalks"&gt;Doha round of trade talks&lt;/a&gt; that have bogged down in an argument between rich and developing nations over access to markets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I am determined that the world economy is stronger, that we show leadership," Brown said. "When markets seize up and investors are not there, the only people who can show leadership to build confidence is governments and they must work together."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Brown also hit back at &lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/georgeosborne"&gt;George Osborne&lt;/a&gt;, the Tory shadow chancellor, who said government plans to borrow more risked a run on the pound.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I regret the partisan talk from the opposition," Brown told the BBC. "When other countries are coming together for a common purpose I think it is the duty of politicians to show responsibility and to show leadership."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div style="float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/economics"&gt;Economics&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/globaleconomy"&gt;Global economy&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/globalrecession"&gt;Global recession&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/worldbank"&gt;World Bank&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/economy"&gt;Economic policy&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk"&gt;guardian.co.uk&lt;/a&gt; &amp;copy; Guardian News &amp; Media Limited 2008 | Use of this content is subject to our &lt;a href="http://users.guardian.co.uk/help/article/0,,933909,00.html"&gt;Terms &amp; Conditions&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/webfeeds/1,,1309488,00.html"&gt;More Feeds&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>Eight in 10 seriously harmed children 'missed' by agencies</title>
      <link>http://www.guardian.co.uk/society/2008/nov/15/baby-p-child-abuse</link>
      <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="http://hits.guardian.co.uk/b/ss/guardiangu-feeds/1/H.15.1/693?ns=guardian&amp;pageName=Society%3A+Eight+in+10+seriously+harmed+children+%27missed%27+by+agencies&amp;ch=Society&amp;c3=The+Guardian&amp;c4=Child+protection+%28Society%29%2CSociety%2CCrime+-+UK+%28News%29%2CUK+news&amp;c5=Society+Weekly%2CNot+commercially+useful%2CChildren+Society&amp;c6=Robert+Booth&amp;c7=2008_11_15&amp;c8=1118339&amp;c9=article&amp;c10=GU&amp;c11=Society&amp;c12=Child+protection&amp;c13=&amp;c14=&amp;h2=GU%2FSociety%2FChild+protection" width="1" height="1" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;More than 80% of children who are killed or seriously injured as a result of abuse or neglect are missed by the national &lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/society/childprotection"&gt;child protection&lt;/a&gt; register, the Guardian can reveal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the week that social workers from Haringey in London were lambasted over the horrific killing of a 17-month-old known as Baby P, and Manchester social services staff faced questions over the deaths of three-month-old Delayno Mullings-Sewell and his two-year-old brother, Romario, the findings show that scores of children who die at the hands of relatives are not on the radar of social services departments, even though in some cases injured babies have had medical treatment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The figures, obtained from unpublished government-commissioned research, show a widespread pattern of missed opportunities where police, social workers and health professionals fail to communicate or act on evidence of potential abuse. Postmortem case reviews included in the research where children died in the care of their families reveal that midwives, hospital staff and social workers saw evidence of abuse while the children were still alive but councils did not place them on the child protection register. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite signs of the abuse being clear to authorities, infants who died from forced starvation, broken ribs and smashed skulls were all missed off the register, which lists 29,200 children "known to be suffering harm". Just 33 of the 189 children whose death or serious injury prompted a local authority serious case review between 2005 and 2007 were on the register, according to the analysis of the most serious cases to be submitted to ministers next spring.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research has raised concerns that, across the country, procedures that should result in children at risk being protected by the government's flagship anti-child abuse system are not being followed, leading to deaths that could be avoided. The number of serious cases in the period 2005-2007 rose 17% on the previous two years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Concerns about the state of child protection have been exposed after the case of Baby P sparked furious clashes in the Commons and triggered two separate government inquiries, one to examine social services in Haringey, the other to revisit the national system established after the case of Victoria Climbi&amp;eacute;, who was murdered in the same north London borough eight years ago. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yesterday at the Old Bailey the three people convicted of involvement in the Baby P case were warned that they face substantial jail terms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Marion Brandon, a University of East Anglia academic who is leading the analysis of serious case reviews, said social workers often struggled to respond appropriately because they found cases frightening and confusing. "They make an early assessment, and don't tend to change their minds," she said. "They keep looking for evidence that supports their view and that can be very dangerous. They might stick to saying it is a case of neglect when it is actually abuse."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Between 2003 and 2005, 45% of children who were killed or seriously injured through abuse or neglect were not known in any way by the social services but may have been on the radar of other public authorities. "In cases where the authorities saw evidence that a child may have been abused, an investigation should have taken place which could result in the child being placed on the register," said Sally Trench, an independent social work consultant who works with local authorities. "There will inevitably be a number of neglected and abused children we don't know about, and I feel particularly concerned about babies and toddlers, who may rarely be seen by any professionals."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Between 2005 and 2007, the majority of serious cases involved a baby under the age of one. In most of those cases, they were younger than six months old. Almost a quarter of cases involved children over 11, with a significant minority aged between 16 and 18. These included suicides, sometimes following a history of abuse, missing persons and some teenagers who were victims of violence from non-family members.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"There are two peaks of vulnerability and danger - babies and older teenagers," said Brandon. "The smallest number we have found is between the ages of six and 10 which is the age bracket of Victoria Climbi&amp;eacute; [who died aged eight] and it was the inquiry into her death which has led to most of the recent learning. Our attention may have been deflected from the greater risks that we know are posed to babies. Since health visitors and midwives routinely work with babies they need to work more closely with social workers so that together they can offer better protection to these very young and potentially vulnerable children."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This month it emerged that three-year-old Tiffany Wright was starved to death in a room above a Sheffield pub despite concern being raised by a midwife and pub regulars. She was not on the child protection register and was found dead from bronchopneumonia and covered in insect bites. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In another case, Jessica Randall, from Kettering, lived for just two months and was referred to hospital several times, at least once with bruising. Her parents were known to social workers, but she was not on the child protection register either. She eventually died from a "massive skull fracture with subdural bleed" and her ribs had been broken.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Councils denied they were being negligent by missing similar cases off the register. "Quite a proportion of those deaths and serious injuries are unpremeditated and appear to come out of the blue," said Colin Green, director of children's services at Coventry city council speaking on behalf of the Association of Directors of Children's Services. "The parent may suffer an acute psychotic episode or there could be an adult suicide which is preceded by the murder of the children. It would have been extremely difficult to discern any threat to children in those cases."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He said the register was considered a "draconian intervention in family life" and that while some children may display bruises or other signs of harm, investigations could be inconclusive. "Judgments need to be made and they are not always going to be right," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the most recent mortality statistics, 84 boys and 64 girls under the age of five died in 2006 from "injuries, poisoning and certain other consequences of external causes".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The causes of death in 38 cases were injuries to the head and neck including fatal fractures of the skull and facial bones and injuries to the thorax. Thirteen infants died from "injuries involving multiple body regions", 15 from the "effects of a foreign body entering through a natural orifice" and 14 from a "foreign body in the respiratory tract". A further 18 died from asphyxiation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A previous study of serious case reviews found that one in three families suffered a combination of domestic violence, mental illness and substance abuse. A third of cases showed evidence of poor living conditions. "We have to understand more about what makes these complicated families tick," Brandon said. "Until we do that, we won't be able to properly grapple with them."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Concern emerged this week that government policy has discouraged councils from decisive intervention in suspected cases of abuse and neglect. Ofsted, the government agency that rates local authority children and young people's services departments, docks marks if children remain on the register for more than two years. Child protection lawyers also believe a steep rise in legal fees associated with taking children into care is putting children at risk. In May the court fee for a local authority to bring such a case to court rose from around &amp;pound;100 to &amp;pound;2,225.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div style="float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/society/childprotection"&gt;Child protection&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/ukcrime"&gt;Crime&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk"&gt;guardian.co.uk&lt;/a&gt; &amp;copy; Guardian News &amp; Media Limited 2008 | Use of this content is subject to our &lt;a href="http://users.guardian.co.uk/help/article/0,,933909,00.html"&gt;Terms &amp; Conditions&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/webfeeds/1,,1309488,00.html"&gt;More Feeds&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>Could it be Clinton for secretary of state? Obama and arch-rival hold secret talks</title>
      <link>http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2008/nov/15/barack-obama-hillary-clinton</link>
      <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="http://hits.guardian.co.uk/b/ss/guardiangu-feeds/1/H.15.1/59095?ns=guardian&amp;pageName=World+news%3A+Could+it+be+Clinton+for+secretary+of+state%3F+Obama+and+arch-rival+hold+secret+talks&amp;ch=World+news&amp;c3=The+Guardian&amp;c4=Obama+White+House+%28News%29%2CHillary+Clinton+%28News%29%2CDemocrats%2CUS+news%2CWorld+news&amp;c5=Not+commercially+useful%2CUS+Elections&amp;c6=Suzanne+Goldenberg&amp;c7=2008_11_15&amp;c8=1118298&amp;c9=article&amp;c10=GU&amp;c11=World+news&amp;c12=Obama+White+House&amp;c13=&amp;c14=&amp;h2=GU%2FWorld+news%2FObama+White+House" width="1" height="1" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/hillaryclinton"&gt;Hillary Clinton&lt;/a&gt;'s hopes of becoming Madam President died months ago - at least for 2008. But could she rise again as Madam Secretary?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Anticipation that Clinton could be called to serve in &lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/obama-white-house"&gt;Barack Obama's cabinet&lt;/a&gt; rose yesterday after his aides leaked details of a secret meeting between the two primary rivals at his transition headquarters in Chicago.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The speculation focused on whether Obama and Clinton were in talks about her serving as secretary of state. But some Democrats said Obama wanted a more general conversation about whether Clinton wanted to stay in the Senate, or serve in his administration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Clinton's visit to Obama's office on Thursday was not on her official schedule, and her Senate staff had previously said she was in Chicago for personal reasons.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She gave little away about her future yesterday, telling a conference in Albany, New York: "I'm not going to speculate or address anything about the president-elect's incoming administration."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Clinton camp was adamant that the meeting was not a job interview. But it has fuelled speculation that Clinton is a contender for a major cabinet post.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since winning the election, Obama has entertained a stream of high-level visitors, but yesterday's meeting was seen as more than an ordinary courtesy call. Clinton campaigned strenuously on Obama's behalf after the primaries, and there has been intense speculation on whether she would be rewarded with a cabinet post.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Journalists staking out Obama's headquarters caught on to the meeting after seeing two separate motorcades of black SUVs leave the building. Clinton, who has secret service protection as a former first lady, normally travels in such a convoy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Aides from the Obama camp, which has been sealed against leaks throughout the campaign and transition, confirmed that a meeting took place. As the Obama camp acknowledges, Clinton would bring a degree of heft as well as celebrity to the job of secretary of state. As she endlessly noted on the campaign trail, she visited more than 80 countries as first lady, building up a reservoir of goodwill for the Clinton brand as well as America. Those assets may overpower any reservations Obama might have about installing his former rival, or of giving an international platform to Bill Clinton as her spouse.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Obama has begun relying heavily on talent first recruited by the Clintons, from Rahm Emanuel, his chief of staff, to John Podesta, who is part of the trio heading his transition team. The Politico website reported that 31 of the 47 appointments to transition or staff posts had worked in the Clinton administration. Clinton also has a number of key defenders in Obama's inner circle. The most influential of these is the vice-president-elect, Joe Biden, a friend of the former first lady.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Obama also relies on a number of trusted allies from Chicago. Last night it emerged that long-term friend and supporter Valerie Jarrett will be named as his White House senior adviser.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jarrett is one of Obama's key advisers and has been close to the president-elect since Jarrett hired Michelle Obama for a job in the Chicago mayor's office in 1991 .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Clinton camp, meanwhile, did not deny the reports of a meeting, but offered no comment. "Any speculation about cabinet or other administration appointments is for president-elect Obama's transition team to address," Philippe Reines, a Clinton adviser, said in an email yesterday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Others in the Clinton camp noted that it could rebound against Obama if he raised hopes only to frustrate them again. Among Clinton supporters, there remains anger that she was passed over as vice-president. A member of her inner circle said: "If they are toying with her and don't give it to her at this point they have a created a political disaster."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Clinton's inclusion on Obama's short-list is seen as a lack of confidence in John Kerry, an early frontrunner for secretary of state. Kerry, who ran for president in 2004, has sent out signals he wants the job, and Obama owes him a debt of loyalty: he came out relatively early in support.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;He said, she said&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Working alongside a former rival is an awkward position for anyone, let alone the US president.

      <title>Rwanda president accuses UN of betrayal and denies backing Tutsi rebels in Congo</title>
      <link>http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2008/nov/15/rwanda-congo</link>
      <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="http://hits.guardian.co.uk/b/ss/guardiangu-feeds/1/H.15.1/74668?ns=guardian&amp;pageName=World+news%3A+Rwanda+president+accuses+UN+of+betrayal+and+denies+backing+Tutsi+rebels+in+Congo&amp;ch=World+news&amp;c3=The+Guardian&amp;c4=Rwanda+%28News%29%2CCongo+%28News%29%2CUnited+Nations+%28News%29%2CWorld+news&amp;c5=Not+commercially+useful%2CCharities&amp;c6=Chris+McGreal&amp;c7=2008_11_15&amp;c8=1118347&amp;c9=article&amp;c10=GU&amp;c11=World+news&amp;c12=Rwanda&amp;c13=&amp;c14=&amp;h2=GU%2FWorld+news%2FRwanda" width="1" height="1" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rwanda's president, Paul Kagame, has accused the &lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/unitednations"&gt;United Nations&lt;/a&gt; of betraying a pledge to combat Hutu extremists in eastern Congo and then blaming his country for the failure of a costly peacekeeping mission to end years of conflict. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In an interview with the Guardian, Kagame dismissed accusations that &lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/rwanda"&gt;Rwanda&lt;/a&gt; is backing the Tutsi rebel leader, Laurent Nkunda, who has seized swaths of territory in the east of the &lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/congo"&gt;Democratic Republic of the Congo&lt;/a&gt; in recent weeks, committing war crimes and prompting another refugee crisis. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The international community spends $1.2bn (&amp;pound;800m) every year on that mission in the Congo. Why would the international community spend so much and say they want to come and deal with the problem and they don't deal with it? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This kind of simplistic approach has to stop by people who run the world, and they [must] really take the bull by the horns and deal with the issue," he said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"That is the reason why people have decided to shift the blame and load it on the shoulders of Rwanda and the Rwandan government just because, in my view, they cannot justify all this. They are in the Congo to support the government to stand on its own feet and solve its own problems. They haven't been very successful. When the problem that was not resolved keeps coming back, they simply say, let's blame it on Rwanda." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rwanda has been accused of providing weapons, soldiers and other backing for Nkunda and his rebel National Congress for the Defence of the People (CNDP) as a means of keeping at bay Hutu extremists who carried out the 1994 genocide of Rwanda's Tutsis, and then fled into Congo. Nkunda says he is fighting to defend Congolese Tutsis from the Hutu forces. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At his official residence in Rwanda's capital, Kigali, Kagame said that his government's ties to Nkunda were superficial. "We're only linked with Nkunda and the CNDP just by accident of history and the fact that these are Congolese who speak Kinyarwanda, and we share borders with Congo," he said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But evidence suggests the links go deeper. Nkunda was an intelligence officer in Kagame's Rwandan Patriotic Front army that in 1994 overthrew the Hutu government that organised the genocide. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Congolese Tutsi rebel leader also played his part when Rwanda invaded Congo - then called Zaire - in 1996 to clear out the refugee camps that had become a base for the defeated Hutu forces to attack Rwanda, and again two years later for a lengthy war that widened to bring in countries such as Angola and Zimbabwe. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rwanda's critics say Nkunda is still acting on Kigali's behalf. They accuse Rwanda of backing him as a proxy in its continuing conflict with Hutu exiles who set up a rebel group, the Democratic Front for the Liberation of Rwanda (FDLR), which controls about 40% of the two Congolese provinces on Rwanda's western border. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;UN officials also suggest that some Rwandan officials are making tidy sums out of the plunder of minerals in Nkunda-held areas and shipped out via Kigali. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kagame acknowledged that Nkunda was serving Rwanda's interests by providing a buffer between its border and the FDLR. But he said that was not a long-term solution. "Does anybody find sense here that if Rwanda is doing the best it can to overcome its own difficulties - only to create problems outside?" asked Kagame. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He said that with Rwanda reorienting itself towards east Africa and the English-speaking world, and trying to build a reputation as a business-friendly, technologically advanced destination for foreign investment, it was not in Kigali's interests to perpetuate the instability in Congo.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"As to whether therefore Nkunda would really be looked at as a solution by Rwanda and therefore supported by Rwanda in this respect, that's not the case. It wouldn't be our choice to look at Nkunda as a solution to our problem."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kagame said the solution was for the UN to send a fighting force to replace the world's largest, and largely ineffective, peacekeeping operation. He wanted that force to fulfil UN commitments to pacify and disarm Hutu rebels and other groups. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I would be happy if that was the case. Really. In fact I'm intending to speak to President Kabila [of Congo]. As a way of getting this unjustified blame off Rwanda, maybe we should make an approach to the UN and really ask what the UN can do in an effective way to deal with this problem. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Can they put together a force to actually deal with all these problems that need military force to deal with it - whether it is FDLR, whether it is other groups fighting the government or even actually, dare I say this, even if this government force is killing its own people? This force should act against them and create a sense of peace and stability."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But neither Kagame nor anyone else has much confidence that will happen. Far from resolving the problem, the UN's failures are helping to escalate it. The Congolese government is bringing in Angolan troops as it did during the 1998-2002 war with Rwanda, potentially widening the conflict again.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kagame said he would be concerned if the Angolans were there to push back the CNDP and expose Rwanda's border to the FDLR. But he said he did not foresee circumstances in which Rwanda would again invade Congo.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"While in the old days we crossed into Congo and dealt with the problem, which I think was very significant, the remnants of the group we were fighting and the magnitude of the problem is smaller and wouldn't warrant us to cross the border. We will deal with it on our side of the border."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Born into a Tutsi family in the western Rwanda region of Gitarama in 1957, Paul Kagame fled to Uganda with his relatives when he was three years old amid growing anti-Tutsi violence. Later he joined the National Resistance Army and spent years fighting the so-called "bush wars" as a guerrilla against the Ugandan government of Milton Obote. In 1986 he was one of the key players behind the establishment of the Rwanda Patriotic Front (RPF), made up mainly of expatriate Rwandan Tutsis. The RPF seized power from the Hutu government in July 1994, helping to bring an end to the genocide in which an estimated 800,000 Rwandans were killed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div style="float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/rwanda"&gt;Rwanda&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/congo"&gt;Democratic Republic of the Congo&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/unitednations"&gt;United Nations&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk"&gt;guardian.co.uk&lt;/a&gt; &amp;copy; Guardian News &amp; Media Limited 2008 | Use of this content is subject to our &lt;a href="http://users.guardian.co.uk/help/article/0,,933909,00.html"&gt;Terms &amp; Conditions&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/webfeeds/1,,1309488,00.html"&gt;More Feeds&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>Sex and the selling of it</title>
      <link>http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/blog/2008/nov/15/prostitution</link>
      <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="http://hits.guardian.co.uk/b/ss/guardiangu-feeds/1/H.15.1/14601?ns=guardian&amp;pageName=Politics%3A+Sex+and+the+selling+of+it&amp;ch=Politics&amp;c3=guardian.co.uk&amp;c4=Prostitution+%28Society%29%2CSociety%2CPolitics&amp;c5=Society+Weekly%2CNot+commercially+useful%2CCommunities+Society&amp;c6=Gaby+Hinsliff&amp;c7=2008_11_15&amp;c8=1118428&amp;c9=article&amp;c10=GU&amp;c11=Politics&amp;c12=blog&amp;c13=&amp;c14=Politics+blog&amp;h2=GU%2FPolitics%2Fblog%2FPolitics+blog" width="1" height="1" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last week during an &lt;a href="http://www.intelligencesquared.com/"&gt;Intelligence Squared&lt;/a&gt; debate on paying for sex, Germaine Greer announced that selling it was better than "selling a child, a kidney or your soul for long hours for wretched pay stacking shelves at Tesco".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The English Collective of Prostitutes is similarly telling anyone who'll listen that lap-dancing may be looked down upon but it's a darn sight more lucrative than the menial, low-paid jobs many dancers would otherwise be stuck with - so do-gooders trying to "rescue" women are doing them no favours.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Meanwhile, Happy hooker memoirs like that of Belle de Jour - now in its second season as a TV adaptation starring Billie Piper - peddle a rose-tinted view of a world where liberated women in control of their lives make a mint from indulging men's sexual peccadilloes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now the government is putting the finishing touches to a review of the sex industry that presents a very different picture of exploited, often drug-addicted women running severe risks in exchange for money, most of which ends up in the hands of dealers and pimps.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Research suggests up to half of prostitutes were in local authority care as children: two-thirds report experiencing "client violence". About 60 have been murdered in the last decade, according to Home Office figures. Hard to imagine Ms Piper starring in a cheery TV drama about that.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;So who's right? Is clamping down on the sex industry helping or harming the women who work in it? Is it vulnerable women ministers really care about, or are they pandering to "respectable" people who dislike kerb crawling or the rise of lap-dancing clubs on their neighbourhoods? We're trying in the &lt;a href="http://observer.guardian.co.uk/"&gt;Observer&lt;/a&gt; this Sunday to unpick some of the complex morality of selling and buying sex.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Meanwhile for a bit of light relief, my colleague Toby Helm is in Washington this weekend with Gordon Brown to follow the critical summit on the economy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;George Osborne's warning today in the Times that Gordon Brown risks a run on the pound by borrowing to fund spending and/or tax cuts - and thereby sending a message that the British economy is in trouble - is starting to create a fine old rumpus. Convention has it that oppositions don't talk about a run on the pound in case the markets respond by, er, starting one.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Whether traders, who no longer seem to respond predictably to almighty interventions by the world banking system, can still be so influenced by a shadow chancellor may be debatable, but Osborne is going to have a nervous weekend waiting for the markets to open on Monday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Expect Labour to raise serious questions about his judgment. Iain Dale &lt;a href="http://iaindale.blogspot.com/2008/11/osborne-slams-sterling-collapse.html"&gt;defends him today&lt;/a&gt; but the argument's already starting on &lt;a href="http://conservativehome.blogs.com/frontpage/2008/11/saturday-15th-n.html"&gt;Conservativehome&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div style="float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/society/prostitution"&gt;Prostitution&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk"&gt;guardian.co.uk&lt;/a&gt; &amp;copy; Guardian News &amp; Media Limited 2008 | Use of this content is subject to our &lt;a href="http://users.guardian.co.uk/help/article/0,,933909,00.html"&gt;Terms &amp; Conditions&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/webfeeds/1,,1309488,00.html"&gt;More Feeds&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>Rugby union: Classy Australia ease past England</title>
      <link>http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/2008/nov/15/autumn-internationals-england-australia</link>
      <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="http://hits.guardian.co.uk/b/ss/guardiangu-feeds/1/H.15.1/96433?ns=guardian&amp;pageName=Sport%3A+Classy+Australia+ease+past+England&amp;ch=Sport&amp;c3=guardian.co.uk&amp;c4=Autumn+internationals%2CEngland+rugby+union+team%2CAustralia+rugby+union+team%2CRugby+union%2CSport&amp;c5=Not+commercially+useful%2CRugby+Union&amp;c6=Michael+Aylwin&amp;c7=2008_11_15&amp;c8=1118601&amp;c9=article&amp;c10=GU&amp;c11=Sport&amp;c12=Autumn+internationals&amp;c13=&amp;c14=&amp;h2=GU%2FSport%2FAutumn+internationals" width="1" height="1" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ah. However promising it may have seemed for England, there was always something not quite right about that Test match against the Pacific Islanders last week. And now we know what it is: it was not a proper Test match.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Australia gave England nothing, took more than was seemly themselves, and as the young home team's belief started to disappear out of the window, to join their composure that had never arrived in the first place, the visitors accelerated to what looked a comfortable win on the scoreboard. More galling for England is that the most decisive turning point of several was a scrum just past the hour in which they were annihilated. And so Australia put paid to several years of hysterical laughter in this part of the world over their scrummaging. Marseille 2007 – that fateful World Cup quarter-final in which England destroyed their scrum – has now been consigned to the past.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But what of England's future, we keep asking. There is no less reason for looking forward to it after this. A little more wit would probably have been enough. Likewise some experience, of which they have an invaluable dollop more now.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yet though they may have turned round at the interval 12-11 down, they had been the better side throughout the first half – or at least produced the more threatening patches of play, which may not be quite the same thing – only to rue a lack of composure that this Australia side was plenty good enough to exploit. But how often have we said that of Australia? This -vintage in particular almost always looks -second best on the field against the -bigger nations but nearly as often can point to a scoreboard that is telling a different story. They are a rope-a-dope team that can absorb blows all day and emerge from the chaos at opportune moments to register points.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;England gifted them six points within almost as few minutes of the first whistle. Tom Rees went off his feet as he went for the ball at a tackle with too much enthusiasm in the third minute, and four minutes later Steve Borthwick piled through a line-out before he should have. Matt Giteau thanked them both and it was 6-0 before anyone had got going.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The highlights of the half, though, were England's. Danny Cipriani ghosted through Australia's midfield to precipitate a tilt at the line by Lee Mears, but Giteau had enough pace to cut him short into touch. From the clearance, though, Delon Armitage took a while to size up his options and sent a low-flying drop goal over from a good 40 metres.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A neat illustration of England's -problems followed soon afterwards. A penalty at a scrum (the much--anticipated scrums were a mess from the off) that represented a likely three points for England was tapped before anyone had time to think about it by the overeager Danny Care. He was isolated, lost the ball and Australia kicked deep. A couple of phases later and hands in the ruck allowed Giteau to make it 9-3.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Then it was 12-3 on the half-hour from another penalty. But to England's credit they got their heads down and drove. Care made some amends by dispossessing Adam Ashley-Cooper after an Armitage up-and-under, and Andrew Sheridan drove close, only to be denied by the video referee. But from the next scrum, England went right and Nick Easter, a robust presence throughout, drove over for the game's first try.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cipriani, who had missed the conversion and an earlier penalty, slotted another shot just before the break, and England trailed by only a point.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The speed and decisiveness of the recovery were encouraging, and England carried on where they left off straight after the break. Cipriani went clean through again. Nothing accrued that time, bar a scuffed drop-goal attempt from same a couple of phases later, but England's golden boy was on target soon after to earn England the lead for the first time with a 48th-minute penalty.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But what happened next? England were charged down, Australia won a five-metre scrum and from it a penalty when Sheridan's hand went to the floor. Giteau slotted from an angle to re-establish Australia's lead.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He lengthened it a few minutes later. Australia still could get nothing going. From one half-hearted attempt, Care ripped the ball off Ashley-Cooper again but was tackled almost immediately. The referee decided he was holding on, and over went Giteau's sixth penalty.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was all most heartening for the Aussies, but their catharsis was yet to come. In the 64th minute there was a scrum just inside England's half. Australia's scrum has been ridiculed here for some years, Sheridan having taken left various Aussie tightheads in a crumpled heap on the floor, never more so than in Marseille last year. The Aussie props had treated this week's abuse in good humour.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now they decided to bite back. Benn Robinson and Al Baxter on either side of Stephen Moore erupted into the England scrum, and the collapse – England's this time – was total. Tom Croft tried to scramble England's ball back in the carnage and the penalty was Australia's. It was an angled 50 metres out, so up stepped Mortlock to exorcise demons of his own; having missed from similar range in the quarter-final last year. This time he nailed it. Much more than that, though, Australia had revenge at last.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Their body language now said as much. The symbolism kept coming. Sheridan limped off a couple of minutes later – nothing to do with a scrum, but the point had been made. And Ashley-Cooper embellished it when he dived over in the corner with Wycliff Palu and Giteau respectively smashing through and toying with the England defence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cipriani was now off, his ankle having taken a worrying knock earlier in the half from which he had never quite recovered. So all of England's new questions had been answered fairly emphatically by Australia, not to mention a load of the hoary old ones. There's a way to go yet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div style="float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/autumn-internationals"&gt;Autumn internationals&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/englandrugbyunionteam"&gt;England rugby union team&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/australiarugbyunionteam"&gt;Australia rugby union team&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/rugbyunion"&gt;Rugby union&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk"&gt;guardian.co.uk&lt;/a&gt; &amp;copy; Guardian News &amp; Media Limited 2008 | Use of this content is subject to our &lt;a href="http://users.guardian.co.uk/help/article/0,,933909,00.html"&gt;Terms &amp; Conditions&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/webfeeds/1,,1309488,00.html"&gt;More Feeds&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="http://hits.guardian.co.uk/b/ss/guardiangu-feeds/1/H.15.1/76400?ns=guardian&amp;pageName=World+news%3A+California+wildfire+chars+Montecito+luxury+belt&amp;ch=World+news&amp;c3=guardian.co.uk&amp;c4=Natural+disasters+and+extreme+weather+%28News%29%2CUS+news%2CWorld+news&amp;c5=Not+commercially+useful%2CCharities&amp;c6=Mark+Tran&amp;c7=2008_11_15&amp;c8=1118424&amp;c9=article&amp;c10=GU&amp;c11=World+news&amp;c12=Natural+disasters+and+extreme+weather&amp;c13=&amp;c14=&amp;h2=GU%2FWorld+news%2FNatural+disasters+and+extreme+weather" width="1" height="1" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Firefighters in southern California were bracing today for the resurgence of a wildfire that has injured 13 people and destroyed 100 homes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;No deaths were reported in the fire itself, but a 98-year-old man died shortly after being evacuated, authorities said. Winds gusting to 70 miles per hour fuelled the fire, which began on Thursday and raged through dry brush and eucalyptus trees to consume rows of luxury homes in Montecito, 90 miles north-west of Los Angeles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Multimillion-dollar houses were reduced to rubble in the area, home to Michael Douglas, Oprah Winfrey and other celebrities. Among those reportedly damaged was the house belonging to Christopher Lloyd, the actor best known as the zany scientist in the Back to the Future movies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Winfrey and the actor Rob Lowe said their properties were spared for the time being. Winfrey began her Chicago-based show talking about the fire and showing live TV news footage of the blaze, which she said was burning "about two miles from my house".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lowe, a neighbour of Winfrey, who stars on the TV drama Brothers &amp; Sisters, said he and his son fled after his wife called them to warn: "Montecito's on fire. Get out."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We got in the car and pulled out of the driveway and the entire mountain behind us was (in) flames 200 feet high, shooting into the air," Lowe told Winfrey in a telephone interview. "It was absolutely Armageddon."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rosie Neeley, 31, fled with her parents before their house was consumed by fire overnight. "When we saw the flames coming down the canyon we knew it was too late," she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Residents of about 5,500 homes were evacuated in Montecito, the neighbouring city of Santa Barbara, and surrounding areas. Arnold Schwarzenegger, the governor of California, declared a state of emergency for Santa Barbara county, sending reinforcements to the local fire departments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;More than 1,000 firefighters fought to contain the blaze ahead of winds that were expected to pick up early today. "It's not a time to relax," said the Santa Barbara deputy fire chief, Tom Franklin. "Everybody's got to be diligent through tonight. It's the last evening of these wind events."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Among the 13 people reported injured, 10 had smoke inhalation and three had burns, the county's emergency operations centre said in a statement. Two of the burns cases were described as serious.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div style="float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/naturaldisasters"&gt;Natural disasters and extreme weather&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/usa"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk"&gt;guardian.co.uk&lt;/a&gt; &amp;copy; Guardian News &amp; Media Limited 2008 | Use of this content is subject to our &lt;a href="http://users.guardian.co.uk/help/article/0,,933909,00.html"&gt;Terms &amp; Conditions&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/webfeeds/1,,1309488,00.html"&gt;More Feeds&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>Ministers look to widen role of post offices</title>
      <link>http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/2008/nov/15/post-office-rural-affairs-government</link>
      <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="http://hits.guardian.co.uk/b/ss/guardiangu-feeds/1/H.15.1/19000?ns=guardian&amp;pageName=UK+news%3A+Ministers+look+to+widen+role+of+post+offices&amp;ch=UK+news&amp;c3=The+Guardian&amp;c4=Postal+service%2CRural+affairs%2CUK+news%2CWelfare+%28Politics%29%2CPolitics&amp;c5=Not+commercially+useful%2CSocial+Care+Society&amp;c6=Patrick+Wintour&amp;c7=2008_11_15&amp;c8=1118369&amp;c9=article&amp;c10=GU&amp;c11=UK+news&amp;c12=Postal+service&amp;c13=&amp;c14=&amp;h2=GU%2FUK+news%2FPostal+service" width="1" height="1" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ministers are to hold a series of meetings with Labour and Tory backbenchers to discuss what extra services the Post Office network could provide, including helping credit unions, dealing with payment of energy bills and the provision of identity-card services. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They are also expected to dust down a Cabinet Office report into potential future services for the Post Office. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The move follows the government's surprise decision this week to scrap the competitive tendering process for the post office card account this week, lifting the threat of closure of a further 3,000 post office branches, due to the threatened loss of the contract to supply benefits and pensions to about 4 million customers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The decision does not prevent the Post Office pressing ahead with its near-complete wave of 2,500 closures created by the Post Office network change programme,  aimed at stemming losses of &amp;pound;500,000 a day. But there is a mood in government, articulated in a letter from Lord Mandelson to Gordon Brown this week, that the remaining 11,5000 post offices could have an enhanced role at a time when the public are losing faith in banks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some backbenchers have talked of the Post Office becoming a people's bank, but different backbenchers have different expectations as to what that would mean. The idea of expanding financial services in the Post Office was highlighted in a 2006 report by the business and enterprise department, which spoke of the possibility of providing travel and car insurance. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is also pointed out that until the sale of the National Girobank to Alliance &amp; Leicester, the Post Office had the functions of a People's Bank. Arguably, with the contraction of the number of big banks, and the general public disdain for them, the Post Office could yet find a niche. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lord Mandelson and the business minister, Pat McFadden, have formed an unlikely alliance with the Communication Workers Union and leftwing backbenchers such as Jon Cruddas to discuss widening the scope of business at post office counters, including directing more government business through the Post Office.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At present, 78% of Department for Work and Pensions business goes through mainstream bank accounts, 20% into post office card accounts and about 2% are paid by Giro. There will also be discussions with local authorities to see if there is any mileage in the Post Office forging closer relations with local government, an idea that has been promoted for nearly 18 months by Kent County Council , but has so far led to only two post offices being reopened or kept alive. The Local Government Association has complained it has not had sufficient information from the Post Office on the viability of individual branches. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The CWU has claimed that an enhanced Post Office could ensure that basic service charges the poor pay are reduced directly by allowing service debits.  Energy and telecoms companies charge customers money for not using direct debits.  A publication by the Save the Children/The Family Welfare Association, estimated that financially excluded and low-income families pay an additional &amp;pound;1,000 a year as a result.   &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cruddas and other backbenchers, such as Kerry McCarthy, have suggested "the People's Bank could also become a vehicle for promoting micro-credit startups".  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mandelson has said he would set up a interdepartmental look at the network's new areas of service, but he would also have to decide how to respond to the wide-ranging review of the Royal Mail prepared for government by Richard Hooper, the former post-comms regulator. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It has been suggested this report would propose joint Royal Mail ventures with the private sector. Mandelson said it would publish its finding within the next few weeks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div style="float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/post"&gt;Postal service&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/ruralaffairs"&gt;Rural affairs&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/welfare"&gt;Welfare&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk"&gt;guardian.co.uk&lt;/a&gt; &amp;copy; Guardian News &amp; Media Limited 2008 | Use of this content is subject to our &lt;a href="http://users.guardian.co.uk/help/article/0,,933909,00.html"&gt;Terms &amp; Conditions&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/webfeeds/1,,1309488,00.html"&gt;More Feeds&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>Sarkozy backs Russian calls for pan-European security pact</title>
      <link>http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2008/nov/15/nicolas-sarkozy-russia-european-security</link>
      <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="http://hits.guardian.co.uk/b/ss/guardiangu-feeds/1/H.15.1/62375?ns=guardian&amp;pageName=World+news%3A+Sarkozy+backs+Russian+calls+for+pan-European+security+pact&amp;ch=World+news&amp;c3=The+Guardian&amp;c4=Nicolas+Sarkozy+%28News%29%2CRussia+%28News%29%2CUS+news%2CFrance%2CUS+foreign+policy%2CUnited+Nations+%28News%29%2CNato+%28News%29%2CWorld+news&amp;c5=Not+commercially+useful%2CCharities&amp;c6=Ian+Traynor%2CLuke+Harding&amp;c7=2008_11_15&amp;c8=1118247&amp;c9=article&amp;c10=GU&amp;c11=World+news&amp;c12=Nicolas+Sarkozy&amp;c13=&amp;c14=&amp;h2=GU%2FWorld+news%2FNicolas+Sarkozy" width="1" height="1" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;President &lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/nicolassarkozy"&gt;Nicolas Sarkozy&lt;/a&gt; of France joined &lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/russia"&gt;Russia&lt;/a&gt; in condemning the Pentagon's plans to install missile defence bases in central Europe yesterday and backed President Dmitri Medvedev's previously ignored calls for a new pan-European security pact.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both presidents concluded a Russia-EU summit, in Nice in the south of &lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/france"&gt;France&lt;/a&gt;, with an agreement to convene a major international conference next summer at which the Americans, Russians and the 27 countries of the EU should come up with a blueprint for new post-cold war "security architecture" in Europe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The call for such a pact has been Medvedev's central foreign policy message since he succeeded Vladimir Putin as president earlier this year. Medvedev has called for the new deal in several keynote speeches but has been snubbed by western leaders until Sarkozy delivered a characteristic surprise yesterday, appearing to hijack the subject.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sarkozy said: "We could meet in mid-2009 to lay the foundations of what could possibly be a future pan-European security system." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Russians see such a deal as a way of halting Nato enlargement and stopping the controversial US missile defence projects in Poland and the Czech Republic. While western European leaders are lukewarm about the Pentagon project and president-elect Barack Obama has yet to reveal his policies, Sarkozy went further yesterday, branding the project a setback for European security.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Deployment of a missile defence system would bring nothing to security in Europe. It would complicate things," said the French leader, who currently chairs the EU. As he attacked the plan, Czech and Polish ministers met in Prague to affirm their support for the installations and send a signal to the Obama administration, pleading for it to go ahead.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I'm 100 per cent sure that Obama won't kill missile defence," Alexandr Vondra, the Czech deputy prime minister, told the Guardian. "The European pillar of missile defence is in the interests of everyone who wants to keep Nato strong."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The French alignment with Russian aims will upset pro-US leaders in western and eastern Europe, but will enjoy support in Germany and Italy, which are eager to draw Russia in as a partner despite the recent invasion of Georgia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yesterday's summit ordered the resumptions of negotiations on a new strategic pact governing relations between Russia and Europe - talks that the EU called off in protest at Russia's invasion of Georgia in August. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In September the Europeans set Moscow an ultimatum for re-opening the talks, demanding that Russian troop positions and numbers be returned to the pre-conflict levels. Russia has ignored the European terms. But yesterday's summit glossed over that.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's as if the military intervention in Georgia never happened. The EU is sending a dangerous signal of weakness," said David Clark, chair of the Russia Foundation, who was an adviser to the former British foreign secretary Robin Cook.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div style="float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/nicolassarkozy"&gt;Nicolas Sarkozy&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/russia"&gt;Russia&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/usa"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/france"&gt;France&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/usforeignpolicy"&gt;US foreign policy&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/unitednations"&gt;United Nations&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/nato"&gt;Nato&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk"&gt;guardian.co.uk&lt;/a&gt; &amp;copy; Guardian News &amp; Media Limited 2008 | Use of this content is subject to our &lt;a href="http://users.guardian.co.uk/help/article/0,,933909,00.html"&gt;Terms &amp; Conditions&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/webfeeds/1,,1309488,00.html"&gt;More Feeds&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>China to make mime a crime for performers</title>
      <link>http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2008/nov/15/china-ministry-culture-music-miming</link>
      <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="http://hits.guardian.co.uk/b/ss/guardiangu-feeds/1/H.15.1/46961?ns=guardian&amp;pageName=World+news%3A+China+to+make+mime+a+crime+for+performers&amp;ch=World+news&amp;c3=The+Guardian&amp;c4=China+%28News%29%2CWorld+news%2CMusic%2CCulture+section&amp;c5=Not+commercially+useful&amp;c6=Tania+Branigan&amp;c7=2008_11_15&amp;c8=1118270&amp;c9=article&amp;c10=GU&amp;c11=World+news&amp;c12=China&amp;c13=&amp;c14=&amp;h2=GU%2FWorld+news%2FChina" width="1" height="1" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Miming at live performances could be banned from next year, China's ministry of culture has announced.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Singers who lip-synch or musicians who pretend to play their instruments twice or more in a two-year period, face having their business licences revoked.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Only professional performers will be covered, which will presumably mean  the country's most celebrated case of faking it - at the opening ceremony of the Beijing Olympics - would be exempt.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nine-year-old Lin Miaoke was lauded around the world for her performance of Ode to the Motherland at the event. But it later emerged she was miming to a recording made by Yang Peiyi, aged seven . Officials replaced the younger girl because they judged Miaoke more photogenic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sun Qiuxia, from the ministry, said it will consult with the public over the next few weeks, before agreeing final details of new rules on commercial performances.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Zheng Jun, a singer who became famous in the late 80s, told Shanghai-based paper Noon News, less than 20%  of stars actually sang at their "live" shows. "I really don't know what sort of an industry I'm involved in," he said . "I once met a well-known singer at a  show who didn't even recognise his song as it was playing, because it had been so long since he'd truly performed it." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;New rules will also ban performers from accepting money for charity events.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div style="float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/china"&gt;China&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk"&gt;guardian.co.uk&lt;/a&gt; &amp;copy; Guardian News &amp; Media Limited 2008 | Use of this content is subject to our &lt;a href="http://users.guardian.co.uk/help/article/0,,933909,00.html"&gt;Terms &amp; Conditions&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/webfeeds/1,,1309488,00.html"&gt;More Feeds&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>Attacks leave Gaza ceasefire near collapse</title>
      <link>http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2008/nov/15/israelandthepalestinians</link>
      <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="http://hits.guardian.co.uk/b/ss/guardiangu-feeds/1/H.15.1/72617?ns=guardian&amp;pageName=World+news%3A+Attacks+leave+Gaza+ceasefire+near+collapse&amp;ch=World+news&amp;c3=The+Guardian&amp;c4=Israel+and+the+Palestinian+territories+%28News%29%2CWorld+news&amp;c5=Not+commercially+useful&amp;c6=Rory+McCarthy&amp;c7=2008_11_15&amp;c8=1118289&amp;c9=article&amp;c10=GU&amp;c11=World+news&amp;c12=Israel+and+the+Palestinian+territories&amp;c13=&amp;c14=&amp;h2=GU%2FWorld+news%2FIsrael+and+the+Palestinian+territories" width="1" height="1" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hamas militants in Gaza fired several rockets into southern Israel yesterday and Israel kept its crossings into the territory closed, as a five-month ceasefire appeared to be collapsing fast.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Violence has returned to the Gaza Strip in the past 10 days. In two separate operations, Israeli forces have killed 10 Hamas gunmen. Hamas, and other militant groups, have responded with several days of rocket fire. Yesterday rockets, including longer-range Grad missiles, hit the Israeli towns of Sderot and Ashkelon. The Israeli military fired at rocket launchers in Gaza and two Palestinian gunmen were reported injured.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/israelandthepalestinians"&gt;Israel&lt;/a&gt; kept its crossings into Gaza shut for the 10th consecutive day, meaning no food, humanitarian supplies or fuel were delivered. Gaza's sole power plant shut down on Thursday night bringing blackouts in Gaza City, although electricity delivered over power lines from Israel and &lt;a href="http://http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/egypt"&gt;Egypt&lt;/a&gt; continued to arrive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The UN Relief and Works Agency (UNRWA), which supports Palestinian refugees, halted food distribution to 750,000 Gazans because its warehouses had run out of food. As many as 20,000 Palestinians are due to collect their regular food baskets today. "Until we are resupplied, we won't have food," said John Ging, head of operations for UNRWA in Gaza. Israel has prevented journalists from entering Gaza for the past 10 days.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was still unclear whether the ceasefire might be salvaged. Ehud Barak, Israel's defence minister, said: "We will keep protecting our soldiers and people and keep acting against attempts to interrupt the ceasefire, but if the other side wish to keep the ceasefire alive, we'll consider it seriously." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The truce,  agreed through Egyptian mediation, has lasted since mid-June and was intended to run for at least six months, with the Palestinians hoping it might eventually extend to the occupied West Bank.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Gaza, Hamas took responsibility for firing the rockets. "The resistance... is able to hit the Zionist depth," said Hamas lawmaker Mushir al-Masri. "Either there's full commitment to the truce and all its conditions, or the resistance will have a position on every Zionist crime." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mahmoud Zahar, Gaza's most senior Hamas leader said in a Friday sermon: "If you want to leave the truce, we are ready. And if you want to continue it, then abide by it."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Benita Ferrero-Waldner, the EU commissioner for external relations, said she was "profoundly concerned" about the closure of the crossings and pressed for a halt to the violence. "I call on Israel to reopen the crossings for humanitarian and commercial flows, in particular food and medicines," she said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div style="float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/israelandthepalestinians"&gt;Israel and the Palestinian territories&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk"&gt;guardian.co.uk&lt;/a&gt; &amp;copy; Guardian News &amp; Media Limited 2008 | Use of this content is subject to our &lt;a href="http://users.guardian.co.uk/help/article/0,,933909,00.html"&gt;Terms &amp; Conditions&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/webfeeds/1,,1309488,00.html"&gt;More Feeds&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>Marine was killed by fire from US jet during Taliban ambush</title>

They died at the scene near Garmsir where the marines have been fighting the Taliban since their first deployment more than two years ago. A third marine was seriously injured.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The board of inquiry into Wigley's death said the pilot of the American F18 navy jet relied on his visual sighting rather than the aircraft's instruments. His ground controller did not adapt his procedures even though he could not see the plane because of the "weight of enemy fire".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The controller, "unaware of the geographic similarities between the enemy and friendly force positions, anticipated that having attacked the target successfully three times [the pilot] knew where it was and could identify it again", the board of inquiry said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The inquiry concluded: "Both acted in the best of intentions under very challenging conditions. The friendly fire incident was a tragic incident, which occurred in a highly-charged environment where lives were at risk." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The "most telling" statement in the inquiry came from Wigley's company sergeant major who had wanted to send a message to the aircrew of the flight after the incident. "This was never actually sent but it was going to say that it had not been a good day at the office for any of them but, had the F18s not been there, they would probably have lost far more men that day," the board's report said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both marines killed on Wednesday were trained as reconnaissance experts and were graduates with 42 Commando based in Plymouth, the MoD said. Dunstan had a degree in French and tourism and McKibben one in environmental science.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dunstan was due to marry in 2010. His fiancee, Kate Miller, said: "Neil was so proud to be a marine and lived each day to the full. He was my soulmate and the love of my life."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From the small town of Westport on the west coast of Ireland, the family of McKibben said: "We are all extremely proud of our Robbie. He had very definite plans of how he wanted to live his life; he was always thoughtful, considerate and had an amazing sense of humour ... He was so full of life and was loved so much by his family and by all his friends."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The men's commanding officer, Lieutenant Colonel Andrew McInerney, described McKibben as "an immensely capable man, yet his humility made him an example and inspiration to all he served with. A true commando - tough, unassuming and hugely convivial, he viewed life as a glass half-full. Regardless of the task or conditions, his 'can-do' attitude helped him and others overcome every test they encountered".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;McInerney said Dunstan "possessed commando qualities in abundance. His quiet confidence and humility was an inspiration to all those who worked with him. A quiet but natural leader, his maturity and intellect made him a valued role model and mentor".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div style="float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/military"&gt;Military&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/afghanistan"&gt;Afghanistan&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/usa"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk"&gt;guardian.co.uk&lt;/a&gt; &amp;copy; Guardian News &amp; Media Limited 2008 | Use of this content is subject to our &lt;a href="http://users.guardian.co.uk/help/article/0,,933909,00.html"&gt;Terms &amp; Conditions&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/webfeeds/1,,1309488,00.html"&gt;More Feeds&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>Public take on the judges over Strictly and X-factor stars</title>
      <link>http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/2008/nov/15/reality-tv-ofcom</link>
      <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="http://hits.guardian.co.uk/b/ss/guardiangu-feeds/1/H.15.1/64843?ns=guardian&amp;pageName=Media%3A+Public+take+on+the+judges+over+Strictly+and+X+Factor+stars&amp;ch=Media&amp;c3=The+Guardian&amp;c4=Reality+TV%2COfcom%2CTelevision+industry+%28Media%29%2CMedia%2CUK+news&amp;c5=Not+commercially+useful%2CMedia+Weekly%2CTelevision+Media&amp;c6=Helen+Pidd&amp;c7=2008_11_15&amp;c8=1118326&amp;c9=article&amp;c10=GU&amp;c11=Media&amp;c12=Reality+TV&amp;c13=&amp;c14=&amp;h2=GU%2FMedia%2FReality+TV" width="1" height="1" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;One has the dancing ability of a wooden horse; the other a voice that could scare a wooden horse. But that hasn't stopped the former political journalist John Sergeant and Daniel Evans, a 38-year-old widowed pool cleaner, from dominating Britain's two top-rated talent shows.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tonight, 64-year-old Sergeant will perform the American Smooth in week nine of BBC1's Strictly Come Dancing, much to the chagrin of even the kindest judge: Len Goodman has despaired of Sergeant's longevity, saying "this isn't Help the Aged, you know". &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He has become such a draw that yesterday the bookmaker William Hill was offering "Sergeant Specials": odds of 6-1 that he scores no points tonight; 3-1 that he scores the lowest points tally in the history of the programme; 10-1 that he makes it into the final just before Christmas; and 33-1 that he wins the whole thing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Over on ITV1, Evans has made it into the X Factor's final seven after invoking the memory of his dead wife throughout the earlier rounds. Fans of Laura White, one of the better singers, were so incensed after her exit last week that 50,000 signed a petition complaining to Ofcom, the independent television regulator. The programme makers insist that there were no irregularities; the simple fact was that far more viewers voted for Evans  than White. But the bookmakers believe that his popularity won't last - William Hill has given him the worst odds of all - 50/1 to win the series.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Not all that long ago, television producers could ask for an audience's opinion and then choose to ignore it - whether it was what to name Blue Peter's new kitten or who should win the public vote at the British Comedy Awards. But ever since TV companies have been fined for misdemeanours involving viewer participation, what the public wants, the public gets. Which is how it has come to this.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Half the votes on Strictly Come Dancing go to the judges, with the rest in the hands of the public. So as Sergeant is reliably at the bottom of the pile after the judges have had their say, he needs more public support than Holby City's Tom Chambers, who has regularly been at the top. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;X Factor viewers initially have the power; then at the end of the show the judges will choose who to save between the two least popular acts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For some viewers, the joke is wearing thin. On the BBC's online message board, many were incensed by the prospect of Sergeant winning the show. Fanofdancing wrote: "This programme is called Strictly Come Dancing not Strictly Entertainment. If it's a popularity contest then why bother to have any dancing at all? People who think it's funny to vote for him are spoiling the competition for those who are lovers of dance." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Clive Hurt,  who runs the CJ School of Ballroom Dance in Cambridge, said: "He is a good social dancer, but for him to go to the final would be like a pensioner competing at the European athletics. It might be rather enchanting, but it wouldn't be right."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Sergeant has some influential fans. The Sun columnist Kelvin Mackenzie urged his readers to vote for "this bullied senior citizen". And despite singing Sergeant's praises under the rather unfortunate headline "Why all women love an ugly man", Esther Ranzten explained the secret of his success. "He makes male viewers of a certain age who, like him, are not as skinny as they once were, feel good about themselves." She added: "He makes female viewers laugh and want to cuddle him."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sergeant says he was "a bit startled" by all the fuss. "We are trying to do our best and if the audience like us, that can't be wrong under the rules of the show," he said. "The point here is whether the judges can keep to the spirit as well as the letter of the rules. It is funny how judges both in real life and on Strictly Come Dancing lose touch with the views of ordinary people."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tale of the tape&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Name &lt;/strong&gt;John Sergeant&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Age &lt;/strong&gt;64&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Occupation &lt;/strong&gt;Former political journalist&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Family &lt;/strong&gt;Married with two sons&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Not to be confused with &lt;/strong&gt;The Churchill insurance dog, a gnome, Jo Brand&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Low point &lt;/strong&gt;Dragging his dance partner along the floor like a mop during the paso doble&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Name &lt;/strong&gt;Daniel Evans&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Age &lt;/strong&gt;38&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Occupation&lt;/strong&gt; Pool cleaner&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Family &lt;/strong&gt;Wife died after giving birth to their daughter&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Not to be confused with&lt;/strong&gt; David Brent, Rick Astley's dad&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Low point&lt;/strong&gt; It was revealed he got two girls pregnant in five months&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div style="float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/realitytv"&gt;Reality TV&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/ofcom"&gt;Ofcom&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/television"&gt;Television&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk"&gt;guardian.co.uk&lt;/a&gt; &amp;copy; Guardian News &amp; Media Limited 2008 | Use of this content is subject to our &lt;a href="http://users.guardian.co.uk/help/article/0,,933909,00.html"&gt;Terms &amp; Conditions&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/webfeeds/1,,1309488,00.html"&gt;More Feeds&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>Guardian Daily podcast: World leaders meet for economic summit and city academies accept fewer poorer children</title>
      <link>http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/blog/audio/2008/nov/14/guardian-daily-podcast</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;In 1944, world leaders met at Bretton Woods in New Hampshire and agreed on a framework of global financial institutions that underpinned economic stability for 25 years. This weekend G20 leaders are meeting to discuss the current economic crisis, in what's been billed as Bretton Woods 2. Economics correspondent &lt;strong&gt;Ashley Seager&lt;/strong&gt; explains what's being discussed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Education editor &lt;strong&gt;Polly Curtis&lt;/strong&gt; has the details of a major review of city academies, the government's flagship schools programme. It says the privately-sponsored schools are accepting a lower proportion of children from poorer backgrounds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chief political correspondent &lt;strong&gt;Nicholas Watt&lt;/strong&gt; scotches rumours that David Cameron is considering moving George Osborne from his post as shadow chancellor amid rumblings of discontent from the Tory backbenches.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Security editor &lt;strong&gt;Richard Norton-Taylor&lt;/strong&gt; looks at whether British forces in Afghanistan have the equipment they need to do the job.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And our Ireland correspondent &lt;strong&gt;Henry McDonald&lt;/strong&gt;, author of a new book, &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Gunsmoke-Mirrors-Henry-McDonald/dp/0717142981/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1226670419&amp;sr=1-1"&gt;Gunsmoke and Mirrors: How Sinn Féin Dressed Up Defeat As Victory&lt;/a&gt;, argues that the IRA did not achieve any of its aims.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Film Weekly podcast: Jason Solomons meets Mark Strong and Paddy Considine</title>
      <link>http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/audio/2008/nov/12/film-weekly-podcast</link>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;If I were a British film-maker and someone gave me a few quid to make a movie, I'd cast two British actors as my leads: Mark Strong and Paddy Considine. They're both always brilliant in whatever film they're in, powerful character actors who hold the screen and who can switch the mood from dark to light and back again in an instant. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Well, I'm not making a film this week, but the very least I can do is have them both on &lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/series/filmweekly"&gt;Film Weekly&lt;/a&gt; for you. Mark Strong, after years of fine work in films from Fever Pitch to &lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/110037/syriana"&gt;Syriana&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/125610/rocknrolla"&gt;RocknRolla&lt;/a&gt;, is finally mixing it with the big boys in Hollywood. He's in &lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/ridley-scott"&gt;Ridley Scott&lt;/a&gt;'s whizz-bang Middle East actioner &lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/126190/body.of.lies"&gt;Body of Lies&lt;/a&gt;, opposite &lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/russellcrowe"&gt;Russell Crowe&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/leonardodicaprio"&gt;Leonardo DiCaprio&lt;/a&gt;. Mark takes a break from filming Guy Ritchie's new Sherlock Holmes movie, with &lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/robertdowneyjr"&gt;Robert Downey Jr&lt;/a&gt;, to talk to us about wigs, baddies and being patient. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Paddy Considine is perhaps best-known for his collaborations with Shane Meadows, as the menace in &lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/101805/dead.man.s.shoes"&gt;Dead Man's Shoes&lt;/a&gt; or A Room for Romeo Brass. He also created memorable characters in Pawel Pawlikowski's &lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/85009/last.resort"&gt;The Last Resort&lt;/a&gt; and My Summer of Love before taking his skills to Hollywood for Jim Sheridan's In America, Ron Howard's &lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/106796/cinderella.man"&gt;Cinderella Man&lt;/a&gt; and Paul Greengrass's &lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/119889/bourne.ultimatum"&gt;The Bourne Ultimatum&lt;/a&gt;. Paddy's back on home turf for his directorial debut Dog Altogether, a moody, blistering short film featuring the mercurial presence of Scottish actor Peter Mullan. Ahead of a career retrospective at Bristol's Encounters Short Film and Animation festival (Nov 18-23), Paddy talks frankly and exclusively to Film Weekly about his work, past and future, and why it's not always up to his own exacting standards. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Also on this week's show, Guardian film critic Peter Bradshaw and I see if the week's films meet our own exacting standards. German blockbuster &lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/126188/baader-meinhof.complex"&gt;The Baader-Meinhof Complex&lt;/a&gt;, Kevin Smith's &lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/126330/zack.and.miri.make.a.porno"&gt;Zack and Miri Make a Porno&lt;/a&gt; and debt documentary &lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/movie/127055/i.o.u.s.a."&gt;I.O.U.S.A&lt;/a&gt; are all up for discussion in our unmissable review section. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Let us know your thoughts, as ever. Have you got a favourite Paddy Considine moment? Have you worked with Mark Strong (he's been in everything, after all)? And if you've seen any of them yet, what did you think of any of the movies we've reviewed?&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Campaigner wins seven-year battle to force rethink on use of pesticides</title>
      <link>http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2008/nov/15/activists-pollution-pesticides-toxins-defra</link>
      <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="http://hits.guardian.co.uk/b/ss/guardiangu-feeds/1/H.15.1/74900?ns=guardian&amp;pageName=Environment%3A+Campaigner+wins+seven-year+battle+to+force+rethink+on+use+of+pesticides&amp;ch=Environment&amp;c3=The+Guardian&amp;c4=Activists+%28Environment%29%2CPollution+%28Environment%29%2CHealth+%28Society%29%2CRural+affairs%2CHealth+policy%2CEnvironment%2CPolitics%2CSociety%2CUK+news&amp;c5=Society+Weekly%2CNot+commercially+useful%2CEthical+Living%2CHealth+Society&amp;c6=David+Adam&amp;c7=2008_11_15&amp;c8=1118311&amp;c9=article&amp;c10=GU&amp;c11=Environment&amp;c12=Activists&amp;c13=&amp;c14=&amp;h2=GU%2FEnvironment%2FActivists" width="1" height="1" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;An environmental campaigner yesterday won a landmark victory against the government in a long-running legal battle over the use of pesticides. The high court ruled that Georgina Downs, who runs the UK Pesticides Campaign, had produced "solid evidence" that people exposed to chemicals used to spray crops had suffered harm. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The court said the government had failed to comply with a European directive designed to protect rural communities from exposure to the toxins. It said the environment department, Defra, must reassess its policy and investigate the risks to people who are exposed. Defra had argued that its approach to the regulation and control of pesticides was "reasonable, logical and lawful".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Downs, who lives on the edge of farmland near Chichester, West Sussex, launched her campaign in 2001. The judge described how she was first exposed to pesticide spraying at the age of 11 "and began to suffer from ill health, in particular flu-like symptoms, a sore throat, blistering and other problems". &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Downs said the government had failed to address the concerns of people living in the countryside "who are repeatedly exposed to mixtures of pesticides and other chemicals throughout every year, and in many cases, like mine, for decades". People were not given prior notification about what was to be sprayed near their homes and gardens, she said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In his ruling, Mr Justice Collins highlighted that the 1986 Control of Pesticides Regulations states that beekeepers must be given 48 hours notice if pesticides harmful to bees are to be used. The judge said: "It is difficult to see why residents should be in a worse position." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Speaking after the ruling, Downs said her seven-year battle was over "one of the biggest public health scandals of our time". She called on Gordon Brown to block any Defra appeal. "The government "should now just admit that it got it wrong, apologise and actually get on with protecting the health and citizens of this country".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The case centred on the way the government assesses the risk posed by pesticides. The current method is based on occasional, short-term exposure to a "bystander" and assumes that individuals would be exposed to an individual pesticide during a single pass. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Downs said: "The judge has agreed with my long-standing charge that this bystander model does not and cannot address residents who are repeatedly exposed." The model does not account for rural residents exposed to mixtures of pesticides and other chemicals "throughout every year and, in many cases like my own, for decades". &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She said: "The fact that there has never been any assessment of the risk to health for the long-term exposure for those who live, work or go to school near pesticide-sprayed fields is an absolute scandal, considering that crop-spraying has been a predominant feature of agriculture for over 50 years."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Downs' campaign has collected evidence from other residents who report health problems including cancer, Parkinson's disease, ME and asthma, which they claim could be linked to crop-spraying.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The judge said "defects" in Defra's approach to pesticide safety contravened a 1991 EC directive. He said Hilary Benn, the environment secretary, "must think again and consider what needs to be done".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A Defra spokesman said: "The protection of human health is paramount. Pesticides used in this country are rigorously assessed to the same standards as the rest of the EU and use is only ever authorised after internationally approved tests ... We will look at this judgment in detail to see whether there are ways in which we can strengthen our system further and also to consider whether it could put us out of step with the rest of Europe and have implications for other member states."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The European parliament's environment committee last week approved new ways of assessing the risk of potentially hazardous sprays to protect crops and plants. The new criteria are part of an attempt to halve the use of toxic products in European farming by 2013. A final vote on the proposals is due next month or in January.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Backstory&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Georgina Downs was first &lt;strong&gt;exposed&lt;/strong&gt; to &lt;strong&gt;pesticide spray&lt;/strong&gt; in the garden of her parents' house near Chichester, West Sussex, in 1984 when she was 11. She suffered several years of &lt;strong&gt;ill health&lt;/strong&gt;, and after &lt;strong&gt;years of study&lt;/strong&gt; into the possible causes, she founded the &lt;strong&gt;UK Pesticide Campaign&lt;/strong&gt; in 2001. A hard-hitting video of a &lt;strong&gt;mannequin picnic &lt;/strong&gt;in her garden, regularly drenched in pesticide spray, helped make her case. She has won &lt;strong&gt;many plaudits and awards,&lt;/strong&gt; and was joint winner of the Andrew Lees Memorial Award at the 2006 British Environment and Media Awards.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div style="float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/activists"&gt;Activists&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/pollution"&gt;Pollution&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/society/health"&gt;Health&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/ruralaffairs"&gt;Rural affairs&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/health"&gt;Health policy&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk"&gt;guardian.co.uk&lt;/a&gt; &amp;copy; Guardian News &amp; Media Limited 2008 | Use of this content is subject to our &lt;a href="http://users.guardian.co.uk/help/article/0,,933909,00.html"&gt;Terms &amp; Conditions&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/webfeeds/1,,1309488,00.html"&gt;More Feeds&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>Ben Goldacre: We're all losers in the numbers game</title>
      <link>http://www.guardian.co.uk/science/2008/nov/15/1</link>
      <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="http://hits.guardian.co.uk/b/ss/guardiangu-feeds/1/H.15.1/97337?ns=guardian&amp;pageName=Science%3A+We%27re+all+losers+in+the+numbers+game&amp;ch=Science&amp;c3=The+Guardian&amp;c4=Science%2CUK+news&amp;c5=Not+commercially+useful&amp;c6=Ben+Goldacre&amp;c7=2008_11_15&amp;c8=1118362&amp;c9=article&amp;c10=GU&amp;c11=Science&amp;c12=&amp;c13=&amp;c14=&amp;h2=GU%2FScience%2F" width="1" height="1" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;We're all suckers for a big number, and you'll be delighted to hear that the Journal of Consumer Research has huge teams of scientists eagerly writing up their sinister research on how to exploit us. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One excellent study this month (DOI: 10.1086/593947) looked at how people choose a camera. The researchers took a single image and made two copies: one where the colours were more vivid, and one where the image was sharper. They told participants each image came from a different camera, and asked which they wanted to buy. A quarter chose the one with the more colourful image. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Then researchers piled it on. They said the other camera had more pixels, using a figure derived from the diagonal width of the sensor. Suddenly more than half picked this camera. Then they told them the other camera had more pixels, but this time they used the number of pixels as evidence: a figure measured in millions. Suddenly, three quarters chose the supposedly better camera.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This week you'll have noticed the news on rosuvastatin, or Crestor. The Jupiter trial on rosuvastatin reported months early, and most papers called it a "wonder drug". "Heart attacks were cut by 54%, strokes by 48% and the need for angioplasty or bypass by 46% among the group on Crestor compared to those taking a placebo or dummy pill," said the Daily Mail. Dramatic stuff. The Guardian said: "Researchers found that in the group taking the drug, heart attack risk was down by 54% and stroke by 48%".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Is this true? Yes. Those are the figures on risk, expressed as something called the relative risk reduction. It is the biggest possible number for expressing the change in risk. But 54% lower than what? The trial was looking at whether it is worth taking a statin if you are at low risk of a heart attack or a stroke, as a preventive measure: it is a huge market - normal people - but these are people whose baseline risk is already very low. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you express the same risks from the same trial as an absolute risk reduction, they look less exciting. On placebo, your risk of a heart attack in the trial was 0.37 events per 100 person years; if you were taking rosuvastatin it fell to 0.17. Woohoo. And if you express the risk as numbers needed to treat, probably the most concrete way of expressing a benefit from an intervention, then a couple of hundred people need to take the pill to save one life. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So is it a good idea for you to take rosuvastatin? That's not my job to say, but the way figures are presented can have a huge impact on the decisions we make. This phenomena has been studied in many groups for many years. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 1993, Malenka et al recruited 470 patients, and gave them details of a hypothetical disease, and a choice of two hypothetical treatments. In fact, it was the same treatment, with the risk expressed in two different ways: 56.8% chose the medication whose benefit was expressed as a relative risk reduction, while only 14.7% chose the medication whose benefit was in absolute terms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Are patients uniquely stupid? Joy, no. The same result has also been found in experiments looking at doctors' prescribing decisions. We're all fooled by big numbers, because we're all idiots. That's why it's important to think clearly, and ignore all newspapers. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;• Please send your bad science to &lt;a href="mailto:bad.science@guardian.co.uk"&gt;bad.science@guardian.co.uk&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk"&gt;guardian.co.uk&lt;/a&gt; &amp;copy; Guardian News &amp; Media Limited 2008 | Use of this content is subject to our &lt;a href="http://users.guardian.co.uk/help/article/0,,933909,00.html"&gt;Terms &amp; Conditions&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/webfeeds/1,,1309488,00.html"&gt;More Feeds&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>Alan Rusbridger reflects on the legacies of Hugo Young following the publication of the legendary columnist's papers</title>
      <link>http://www.guardian.co.uk/books/2008/nov/15/politics</link>
      <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="http://hits.guardian.co.uk/b/ss/guardiangu-feeds/1/H.15.1/25959?ns=guardian&amp;pageName=Books%3A+Off+the+record&amp;ch=Books&amp;c3=The+Guardian&amp;c4=Politics+%28Books+genre%29%2CBooks%2CCulture+section%2CPolitics&amp;c5=Not+commercially+useful&amp;c6=Alan+Rusbridger&amp;c7=2008_11_15&amp;c8=1117840&amp;c9=article&amp;c10=GU&amp;c11=Books&amp;c12=Politics&amp;c13=&amp;c14=&amp;h2=GU%2FBooks%2FPolitics" width="1" height="1" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;On July 21 1997, Tony Blair, Hugo Young and I met for tea in the garden of Number 10. The prime minister was reasonably assiduous in talking things over with columnists and editors and on this day we chatted in the summer sun for 90 minutes or so. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A couple of days later an immaculate record of the meeting arrived in the post from Hugo. He had taken no notes during the conversation - but here it was in perfect summary. It was the first time I perceived this particular facet of Hugo's distinction as a political columnist. I had often seen him asking penetrating questions - questions that hinted at the quality of Hugo's mind, accumulated knowledge and intellect - but I'd never before seen how he systematically noted and ordered his reporting. His columns, first for the Sunday Times and from 1984 onwards for the Guardian, were like icebergs: readers saw a sunlit tip of crystal argument. They may have guessed but they never truly saw what lay beneath. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When Hugo died in 2003 he left behind more than 30 years of meticulous notes of lunches, phone calls and briefings with the great players of the age. Each set had been typed up as soon as he returned to his study, while the detail of a conversation was still fresh. Any policeman or lawyer will tell you of the value of contemporaneous notes. Historians of modern British politics would have formed a queue around the block from his home in London's Christchurch Hill for access to those files. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here was a dilemma; aside from a few general exchanges at social events most of the conversations had to be considered off the record. One option would have been to destroy the papers. But it had been Hugo's stated wish that they be preserved, at the very least for the benefit of scholars, though he gave no clear instructions about the circumstances, or timescale, under which they could be used. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Modern-day politics operates in the uncertain twilight domain of not quite public, not quite private. Since Richard Crossman and Tony Benn there has been a torrent of diaries from people in British public life. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Time frames have become compressed: where once it was considered decent to wait 30 years before opening the filing cabinets to public scrutiny, the main players now rush to do deals before their market - or simple curiosity - value fades. The Blair government has already been chronicled by a swarm of the participants - political, diplomatic and mandarin. Robin Cook, Mo Mowlam, Clare Short, Alastair Campbell, David Blunkett, Jonathan Powell, Christopher Meyer, Cherie Blair, Giles Radice and John Prescott are among those who have published inside accounts of Tony Blair's time in power - and Blair is working on his own version. Margaret Thatcher, John Major and Paddy Ashdown and a host of others have contributed to a small library of memoirs of life in government and opposition. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Freedom of Information legislation now allows journalists more or less immediately to prise open some doorways into public life that used to be sealed for decades. Today, even the 30-year rule that once delayed the release of the vast bulk of public documents is being reviewed. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But where does this new freedom for politicians and their associates to tell all leave journalists? Every day, politicians tell journalists things that are "unattributable", on "lobby terms", "for guidance only" or "off the record". Their motives may be mixed - from misleading and spinning via persuasion and advocacy to enlightening and informing. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some journalists (and not a few readers) nurse anxieties about the amount of information which is not clearly attributable. Most journalists appreciate the trade off: they can often get the reader closer to what is actually happening if they can disguise their sources. A journalist who keeps a meticulous record of who unattributably said what at a particular moment creates an archive of potential significance. Where that journalist is a figure of Hugo's distinction and access, the archive grows into something historically important. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After Hugo's death, a small group of his family and friends met to resolve the issue. It would have been unthinkable either to destroy Hugo's papers or to place them immediately in the public domain. The collection was taken to the Guardian archive, which had been established with Hugo's enthusiastic support, and, after cataloguing, a decision was taken to publish extracts from the papers so long as every living participant in the off-the-record conversations was traced and gave permission.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's fair to say that a small number of Hugo's former confidantes thought that his papers should be kept under lock and key. Some considered that a fundamental accord between politicians and the fourth estate would be broken if the former believed their off-the-record conversation would ever be made public.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The overwhelming majority of those we contacted were, however, perfectly relaxed about publication, though some asked for minor passages to be excised. "It was off the record at the time," a distinguished former cabinet minister rang me to say, "but I'm happy for it to be published now. But can you take out one sentence about X. I stand by it, but he is currently very unwell and I have no wish to add to his family's unhappiness at the moment."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many were surprised that Hugo had recorded their long-forgotten exchanges but several declared themselves "fascinated" to be reminded. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some had quibbles about use of language ("I think Hugo was para-phrasing what I said") or small details of fact. But most were pleased that their exchanges with Hugo should now see the light of day; some even offered their help decoding his cryptic abbreviations. Even among the minority who declined, a few apologised for doing so. "If I were out of government, I wouldn't hesitate to greenlight this," said one.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are precedents. All of CP Scott's diaries and letters and notes have been in the public domain for decades. Anyone can read his encounters and correspondence with Lloyd George, Kerensky, Churchill, Woodrow Wilson, Lord Curzon, Lord Smuts, Ramsay MacDonald. Similarly Alastair Hetherington, editor of the Guardian between 1956 and 1975, bequeathed all his papers to the LSE. His diaries record that he had 99 deeply off-the-record meetings with Harold Wilson, 54 of them during Wilson's premierships. Many of them took place with no one else in the room: Wilson talked about the major issues of the day, including Rhodesia, Vietnam, Profumo, the Middle East, nuclear defence, the timing of general elections and future Cabinet appointments. An interesting thesis remains to be written comparing these exchanges with contemporary public pronouncements and the paper's coverage of the "official" story.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Political memoirs are written with hindsight. The value of Hugo Young's papers is that we glimpse what politicians thought at the time; what was happening behind scenes, or what they thought was happening. That might be quite different from the contemporary narrative that was publicly available or from the narrative subsequently constructed with half an eye on history. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Besides this, the papers contain a lesson for all aspiring - and practising - journalists in seeing how a great writer and reporter such as Hugo worked. The diligent taking of notes helped make Hugo the formidable commentator he was. Collectively they make the case for the eternal value of reporting. The Guardian's centenary history makes the claim that Peterloo [as recorded by the Manchester Guardian's founder, John Edward Taylor] "is the debut of the reporter in English public life". Hugo's work stands in that tradition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div style="float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/books/politics"&gt;Politics&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk"&gt;guardian.co.uk&lt;/a&gt; &amp;copy; Guardian News &amp; Media Limited 2008 | Use of this content is subject to our &lt;a href="http://users.guardian.co.uk/help/article/0,,933909,00.html"&gt;Terms &amp; Conditions&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/webfeeds/1,,1309488,00.html"&gt;More Feeds&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>Jonathan Glancey: Shopping and circuses</title>
      <link>http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2008/nov/15/millennium-dome</link>
      <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="http://hits.guardian.co.uk/b/ss/guardiangu-feeds/1/H.15.1/13098?ns=guardian&amp;pageName=Comment+is+free%3A+Shopping+and+circuses&amp;ch=Comment+is+free&amp;c3=The+Guardian&amp;c4=Shopping+%28Travel%29%2CLife+and+style%2CLondon+%28News%29&amp;c5=Fashion+and+Beauty%2CNot+commercially+useful&amp;c6=Jonathan+Glancey&amp;c7=2008_11_15&amp;c8=1118280&amp;c9=article&amp;c10=GU&amp;c11=Comment+is+free&amp;c12=blog&amp;c13=&amp;c14=Comment+is+free&amp;h2=GU%2FComment+is+free%2Fblog%2FComment+is+free" width="1" height="1" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chariot racing is to come to the Dome. Sorry, the O2 Arena, or what was once the great tented home of the embarrassing and largely forgotten Millennium Experience. The announcement was made days after the opening of the Westfield shopping mall, the most ambitious yet of London's public playpens for those in need of brash and glittering entertainment on a mammoth scale.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like the Millennium Experience, malls are a successor to the unofficial Roman policy of doling out "bread and circuses" (or "games" or "entertainment", depending on how you translate Juvenal's Latin mockery). Free bread, or wheat, and cheap entertainment in public arenas and imperial baths did their bit to keep the population of a vast, sprawling, noisy, cosmopolitan and hugely energetic city passive. London, a vast, sprawling, noisy, cosmopolitan and hugely energetic city, is easily seen as a slightly cloudy ancient Rome. It is hard to hear about chariot races at the Dome and not think of Juvenal's jibe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Whereas, sniped Decimus Junius Juvenalis (AD55-127), responsible republican Romans had once taken their civic responsibilities seriously, now they "meddle no more and long eagerly for just two things" - panem et circenses&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He was thinking of cheap seats for sensationally violent games in the Colosseum and thrillingly dangerous chariot races in the Circus Maximus. From next autumn, the German producer Franz Abraham will be entertaining us with a live-action version of the Hollywood epic Ben Hur to mark its 50th anniversary. Sets will be designed by Mark Fisher, the man behind the determinedly populist British contribution to the closing ceremony of the Beijing Olympics - itself a product of "bread and circuses" thinking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In true Colosseum style, the show promises "100" performing animals. Horses. Camels. Eagles. Falcons. And "chickens". There will also be five "quadrigas", or four-horsed chariots, belting around the place. Londoners are promised a "high level of artistry" and, doubtless, everything will be done in the best possible taste.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2000, I wrote a little book called London: Bread and Circuses. My feeling was that recent governments had assumed that Londoners have been so happy shopping, eating and being entertained that they have been careless of how their buses and trains, their schools and hospitals, are financed and run. But they do care, and are well aware that peace offerings such as the lavish millennium buildings, sponsored by a lottery and global corporations, are a poor substitute for a creaking infrastructure. Bread and circuses are not enough.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With his love of ancient Rome, Boris Johnson must be aware of the ways in which Londoners, and the British in general, have since 2000 been spoon-fed with ever more gimcrack and large-scale entertainments, whether in the guise of the Westfield shopping mall - which the mayor himself declared open - the  2012 Olympics, or now, going the whole sus (Latin for hog), chariot racing in the Dome, London's Colosseum.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chariot racing in North Greenwich might well be enjoyable. It is easy to imagine Frankie Dettori jostling with Lewis Hamilton at the reins, interspersed with such crowd-pleasers as Jonathan Ross and Russell Brand being fed to the lions. Equally, it is clear that we have come both a long way and nowhere at all since the heyday of ancient Rome, and Londinium. Of course, there is something in us that thrills, guiltily or not, to gladiator fights, public executions - the biggest crowd-pullers in 18th and 19th century London - football games, motor racing and the Christmas sales, but chariot racing in the Dome takes the panis biscoctus&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jonathan Glancey is the Guardian's architecture critic &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="mailto:jonathan.glancey@guardian.co.uk"&gt;jonathan.glancey@guardian.co.uk&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div style="float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/travel/shoppingtrips"&gt;Shopping trips&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/london"&gt;London&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk"&gt;guardian.co.uk&lt;/a&gt; &amp;copy; Guardian News &amp; Media Limited 2008 | Use of this content is subject to our &lt;a href="http://users.guardian.co.uk/help/article/0,,933909,00.html"&gt;Terms &amp; Conditions&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/webfeeds/1,,1309488,00.html"&gt;More Feeds&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>A breath of fresh air: Hugh Fearnley-Whittingstall on the comfort salad</title>
      <link>http://www.guardian.co.uk/lifeandstyle/2008/nov/15/winter-vegetables</link>
      <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="http://hits.guardian.co.uk/b/ss/guardiangu-feeds/1/H.15.1/65227?ns=guardian&amp;pageName=Life+and+style%3A+A+breath+of+fresh+air&amp;ch=Life+and+style&amp;c3=The+Guardian&amp;c4=Cheese+%28recipes%29%2CPork+%28recipes%29%2CSalad+%28recipes%29%2CSpicy+%28recipes%29%2CVegetables+%28recipes%29%2CVegetarian+%28recipes%29%2CFree+from+%28recipes%29%2CMain+course+%28recipes%29%2CSide+dishes+%28recipes%29%2CStarter+%28recipes%29%2CFood+and+drink+%28Life+and+style%29%2CLife+and+style&amp;c5=Not+commercially+useful%2CFood+and+Drink&amp;c6=Hugh+Fearnley-Whittingstall&amp;c7=2008_11_15&amp;c8=1117163&amp;c9=article&amp;c10=GU&amp;c11=Life+and+style&amp;c12=Cheese+recipes&amp;c13=&amp;c14=&amp;h2=GU%2FLife+and+style%2FCheese+recipes" width="1" height="1" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;It would be easy to muffle the inevitable fall into winter with pillows of mashed potato and vats of comforting stew. And not for a moment would I begrudge you such a soft, cosy landing. But these body-hugging treats soon lose their charms when dished up day after day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The truth is there's more to comfort food than Lancashire hot pot, jam roly poly and their ilk. We need a bit of zest and crunch mixed up amid the gravy, starch and cream - otherwise, we might as well hibernate. My answer to this challenge is the comfort salad, and the key to the comfort salad is the exciting crop of winter veg, now just coming on stream.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Roasting the veg, especially roots and squashes, but also the alliums - whole garlic cloves, shallots, small onions, even chunks of leek - is a good place to start, because it emphasises the natural sugars, and a hint of burn on the cut edges gives that toffeeish taste that works so well when there's a nip in the air. You can do it with celeriac, Jerusalem artichokes, parsnip and chunky autumn carrots - and in this context treat chunks of butternut or crown prince squash as an honorary root. All are plentiful right now.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The key to a good salad - in winter or summer - is not to overload your bowl with too many ingredients and to ensure pleasing contrasts in the ones you do use. Combine the soft, yielding texture of roast squash, say, with the nibble of toasted walnuts, the earthiness of beetroot with the sweetness of pear and the creamy tang of blue cheese. Dressings may be richer than the ones used at sunnier times of year - as in my remoulade here - but that richness is tempered by the stealthy heat of mustard to ensure it enlivens rather than lulls.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These chunks of toasty root and sweet, caramelised allium can be simply tossed with a few winter leaves and a good dressing (moi, je ne vinaigrette rien). Some nuts or crumbled cheese, or both, finish the job. Spicy and bitter leaves such as tatsoi, mizuna, rocket, mustard, fris&amp;eacute;e and chicory are all the rage - but if you prefer milder, more succulent leaves, lamb's lettuce or purslane will do very nicely. And flat-leaf parsley is a cracking and underrated winter salad leaf, if you like your leaves aromatic, but not hot or cabbagey.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I hope you'll throw together your own comfort salads according to whim - you know what you like. If the salady equivalent of spotty red socks and bobble hat with a big winter overcoat is your bag, then be my guest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Pear, beetroot and blue cheese salad&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;A great combination of sweetness and earthiness, with the blue cheese adding a piquant tang. Serves four.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;About half a dozen medium beetroot, or a dozen small beetroot&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4 tbsp olive oil&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;5 garlic cloves, unpeeled and bashed a bit&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;5-6 sprigs fresh thyme, plus a good sprinkling of thyme leaves to garnish the finished salad&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2-3 sprigs fresh rosemary&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Salt and pepper&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2 ripe pears&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;120g Dorset Blue Vinney, or other blue cheese&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1 tbsp runny honey&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Preheat the oven to 180C/350F/gas mark 4. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Give the beetroot a really good scrub under the tap, then parboil them for about 10 minutes. Drain, peel off the skins, cut into chunks, then tip into a roasting tin along with the olive oil, garlic, thyme sprigs and rosemary. Roll everything around a bit so it's all well coated, then season generously. Roast for about 30 minutes, shaking the tin from time to time, until the beetroot are soft when pierced with a knife. Strain and reserve the tasty oil.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Peel the pears and cut into slices. Divide between four plates, adding a couple of slices of cheese and some of the beetroot to each one. Drizzle over the honey and the roasting juices, sprinkle on some thyme leaves and salt and pepper and serve immediately.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Roast squash, chilli and walnut salad&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Delicious just as it is, but you could add some shredded, roasted pheasant or chicken if you like. Serves four to six.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1 medium or 2 small squash such as butternut or crown prince&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4 cloves garlic, unpeeled and bashed a bit&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3-4 sprigs fresh marjoram&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2-3 sprigs fresh rosemary&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1-2 red chillies, deseeded and chopped&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;70ml olive oil, plus a little extra olive or rapeseed oil for dressing the finished dish&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Salt and pepper&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1 good handful walnuts, toasted&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2 handfuls fresh flat-leaf parsley, tough stalks removed, then roughly chopped&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Juice of &amp;frac12; lemon&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Preheat the oven to 180C/350F/gas mark 4. Peel and deseed the squash, then cut it into chunks. (Reserve the seeds for growing next year's squash crop; or just toast and crack them open for a quick and easy snack.) Pack the squash quite tightly into a roasting tin along with the garlic, marjoram, rosemary, chillies and oil. Season well, then pour over a couple of tablespoons of water. Cover tightly with foil and bake for 30 minutes. Remove the foil and roast for a further 30 minutes, turning over a couple of times. Take the tin out of the oven, remove the herbs, then tip the pumpkin into a bowl. Toss with the walnuts and parsley, season and squeeze over the lemon. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Divide between four plates and dress with a little olive or rapeseed oil before serving.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Celeriac remoulade with sausages&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;This classic French salad is a winter favourite. The dressing works well on grated carrot or shredded cabbage, too. I've used sausages here, but this remoulade also goes brilliantly with chopped ham or leftover pork. Serves six to eight.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3-4 sausages (I like to use spicy merguez for this dish)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2 tsp hot English mustard&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2 tsp cider vinegar&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1 scant tsp sugar&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1 pinch salt&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;75ml olive oil&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;75ml groundnut or sunflower oil&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1 celeriac, weighing about 750g&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cook the sausages, then set them aside on some kitchen paper and leave to cool. In a bowl, whisk together the mustard, vinegar, sugar and salt. Pour the oils into a jug, then very slowly trickle them into the mustard mixture, whisking all the time, until you get a creamy, emulsified dressing. Taste and adjust the seasoning if necessary.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Peel the celeriac, cut it into matchsticks and toss these in the dressing. Leave for about 30 minutes, to give the flavours a chance to blend, then cut the sausages into 1cm slices and fold into the celeriac. Serve with slices of good bread and butter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;• To order River Cottage 2009, your seasonal guide to the year with a week-to-view diary, for &amp;pound;9.50 (plus p&amp;p), go to &lt;a href="http://www.rivercottage.net"&gt;rivercottage.net&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div style="float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/lifeandstyle/cheese"&gt;Cheese recipes&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/lifeandstyle/pork"&gt;Pork recipes&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/lifeandstyle/salad"&gt;Salad recipes&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/lifeandstyle/spicy"&gt;Spicy recipes&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/lifeandstyle/vegetablesrecipes"&gt;Vegetable recipes&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/lifeandstyle/vegetarian"&gt;Vegetarian recipes&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/lifeandstyle/freefrom"&gt;Free from recipes&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/lifeandstyle/maincourse"&gt;Main course recipes&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/lifeandstyle/sidedishes"&gt;Side dish recipes&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/lifeandstyle/starter"&gt;Starter recipes&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/lifeandstyle/foodanddrink"&gt;Food &amp; drink&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk"&gt;guardian.co.uk&lt;/a&gt; &amp;copy; Guardian News &amp; Media Limited 2008 | Use of this content is subject to our &lt;a href="http://users.guardian.co.uk/help/article/0,,933909,00.html"&gt;Terms &amp; Conditions&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/webfeeds/1,,1309488,00.html"&gt;More Feeds&lt;/a&gt;</description>

Serves four.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;15g dried porcini&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;600g mixed mushrooms (wild and/or cultivated)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;350g sourdough bread&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;100ml olive oil&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2 garlic cloves, crushed&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Salt and black pepper&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1 medium onion, peeled and sliced&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1 medium carrot, peeled and sliced&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3 celery stalks, sliced&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;120ml white wine&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3 sprigs fresh thyme&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;100g soured cream&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4 tbsp chopped tarragon and parsley&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4 duck eggs, freshly poached&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Drizzle of truffle oil (or olive oil)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Soak the porcini in water for 30 minutes. Gently brush the fresh mushrooms, then cut the larger ones so you have a good selection of whole or large chunks. Preheat the oven to 200C/400F/gas mark 6.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Remove the crust from the sourdough, and cut the bread into roughly 2.5cm cubes. Put these in a bowl, add two tablespoons of oil, two cloves of crushed garlic and a pinch of salt, and toss. Spread the croutons on an oven tray and toast in the oven for 17 minutes, turning a few times, until they are nice and golden all over.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Heat a tablespoon of oil in a heavy saucepan. Add some of the mushrooms, leave undisturbed for a minute or two so they don't exude their juices, then, once lightly browned, turn them over for another minute. Remove from the pan and repeat in batches with the remaining mushrooms, adding a tablespoon of oil every time. Once all the mushrooms have been seared, add another tablespoon of oil to the pan and throw in the onion, carrot and celery. Saut&amp;eacute; on medium heat for five minutes without browning. Add the wine and let it bubble away for a minute. Strain the porcini, squeeze out the liquid and tip the soaking liquids into the pan. Add enough water to bring up to 600ml.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Add the thyme and a little salt, and simmer slowly for 20 minutes, or until you are left with just under a cup of liquid. Strain, discard the vegetables and return the liquids to the pan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When ready to serve, reheat the stock, add the mushrooms, soured cream and the herbs (reserve some to garnish), and season to taste.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As soon as the mushrooms are hot, place four croutons on each serving dish. Top with mushrooms, a warm poached egg, the remaining herbs, a drizzle of oil and some black pepper.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;• Yotam Ottolenghi is chef/patron of Ottolenghi in London.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div style="float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/lifeandstyle/eggs"&gt;Egg recipes&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/lifeandstyle/vegetablesrecipes"&gt;Vegetable recipes&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/lifeandstyle/vegetarian"&gt;Vegetarian recipes&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/lifeandstyle/freefrom"&gt;Free from recipes&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/lifeandstyle/foodanddrink"&gt;Food &amp; drink&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk"&gt;guardian.co.uk&lt;/a&gt; &amp;copy; Guardian News &amp; Media Limited 2008 | Use of this content is subject to our &lt;a href="http://users.guardian.co.uk/help/article/0,,933909,00.html"&gt;Terms &amp; Conditions&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/webfeeds/1,,1309488,00.html"&gt;More Feeds&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>Stelios raises easyJet stake and threatens to return as chairman</title>
      <link>http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/2008/nov/15/easyjet-airline-industry</link>
      <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="http://hits.guardian.co.uk/b/ss/guardiangu-feeds/1/H.15.1/37025?ns=guardian&amp;pageName=Business%3A+Stelios+raises+easyJet+stake+and+threatens+to+return+as+chairman&amp;ch=Business&amp;c3=The+Guardian&amp;c4=Easyjet+%28Business%29%2CAirline+industry+%28business%29%2CBusiness&amp;c5=Business+Markets&amp;c6=David+Teather&amp;c7=2008_11_15&amp;c8=1118325&amp;c9=article&amp;c10=GU&amp;c11=Business&amp;c12=Easyjet&amp;c13=&amp;c14=&amp;h2=GU%2FBusiness%2FEasyjet" width="1" height="1" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;A rift between easyJet and the airline's flamboyant founder, Sir Stelios Haji-Ioannou, erupted into the open yesterday after the tycoon increased his stake in the business and threatened to reinstate himself as chairman.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The board of the budget airline made public the details of an email sent by Haji-Ioannou to the company late on Thursday. In it, the airline's founder disclosed that he had lifted his stake from 15.6% to almost 27%, after taking control of his sister's shares. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Haji-Ioannou said he wanted to appoint two representatives to the board or else exercise his right to name himself chairman. The tycoon remains a non-executive director but has not been chairman since 2002.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The two sides are at odds over strategy. Haji-Ioannou is demanding that the carrier because of the slowing economy, stoking some speculation over the financial health of his easyGroup empire, which operates businesses from hotels to pizza delivery to men's toiletries. EasyJet has never paid dividends in its eight years as a public company, preferring to invest for growth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In an emailed response to questions, Haji-Ioannou said: "I am merely applying my rights under the articles of association of the company to protect my investment in easyJet." He said his request was for the company to pay a dividend by 2011 "if the markets allow".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company said it had been taken by surprise. In a statement, chairman Sir Colin Chandler said "there has been a far-reaching debate over these issues", adding that "the ongoing dialogue with Sir Stelios continued" during a scheduled board meeting on Thursday, when it appeared as though a resolution was in reach. He said dialogue would continue, but noted: "I would like to make it clear up front that the other non-executive directors and I fully support the executive management of the company."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The board includes Channel 5 chairman Dawn Airey, former Alliance &amp; Leicester executive David Bennett, Ladbrokes boss Sir David Michels, and John Browett, who runs DSG International, the owner of Currys, Dixons and PC World.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The relationship between Haji-Ioannou and the company began to sour in summer when the tycoon filed a claim in the high court accusing the carrier of breaking its licence agreement by starting too many ancillary businesses, including a credit card and hotel-booking website. The case is still rumbling through the courts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At an investor day in September, the airline outlined plans to take delivery of 85 new aircraft in the next three years, adding 35 craft to the fleet and bringing it to 200, after taking into account the retirement and sale of older planes. The aim is to build routes to mainland Europe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At its full-year results due next week, however, the airline is expected to pare back its ambitions. In the statement, the company defended its plans and said it was already taking a "cautious" approach to spending.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;EasyJet said its full-year figures would be in line with market expectations, adding that forward bookings and total revenue per seat are running slightly ahead of last year. The company is expected to report profits of &amp;pound;115m, a little over half the previous year's &amp;pound;202m.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Haji-Ioannou, 41, who was born in Cyprus, started easyJet when he was 28, floating the business on the stockmarket in 2000. His brother Polys owns a further 11.3% of the airline.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pressed about the financial state of easyGroup, Haji-Ioannou responded: "I am doing very well financially, considering the macro climate, thank you. I have no leverage at all."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shares in easyJet have more than halved in price since the start of the year, costing the businessman a paper loss of around &amp;pound;170m.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Douglas McNeill, airline analyst at stockbrokers Blue Oar, said the market was still digesting the situation. "On the one hand you have conflict at board level, which is undesirable. But there is also the prospect of a change of strategy and the distribution of cash," he said. "The rapid rate of expansion that has been planned requires a huge amount of cash to be spent on new planes. Stelios clearly thinks that cash could be better used elsewhere."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div style="float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/easyjet"&gt;Easyjet&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/theairlineindustry"&gt;Airline industry&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk"&gt;guardian.co.uk&lt;/a&gt; &amp;copy; Guardian News &amp; Media Limited 2008 | Use of this content is subject to our &lt;a href="http://users.guardian.co.uk/help/article/0,,933909,00.html"&gt;Terms &amp; Conditions&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/webfeeds/1,,1309488,00.html"&gt;More Feeds&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>Lehman administrators' task will dwarf Enron, creditors told</title>
      <link>http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/2008/nov/15/lehman-brothers-us-economy</link>
      <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="http://hits.guardian.co.uk/b/ss/guardiangu-feeds/1/H.15.1/53442?ns=guardian&amp;pageName=Business%3A+Lehman+administrators%27+task+will+dwarf+Enron%2C+creditors+told&amp;ch=Business&amp;c3=The+Guardian&amp;c4=Lehman+Brothers%2CUS+economy+%28Business%29%2CBanking+sector+%28Business%29%2CBusiness%2CWorld+news&amp;c5=Investments%2CCredit+Crunch%2CNot+commercially+useful%2CBusiness+Markets%2CUS+Economy&amp;c6=Simon+Bowers&amp;c7=2008_11_15&amp;c8=1118354&amp;c9=article&amp;c10=GU&amp;c11=Business&amp;c12=Lehman+Brothers&amp;c13=&amp;c14=&amp;h2=GU%2FBusiness%2FLehman+Brothers" width="1" height="1" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Administrators grappling with the European arm of the failed investment bank Lehman Brothers have told creditors their task is "10 times as big and as complicated" as the unwinding of Enron.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Speaking after the first creditors' meeting, a team from PricewaterhouseCoopers said they had identified more than $1tn (&amp;pound;670bn) in assets and liabilities that need to be accounted for.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the meeting, held behind closed doors in a conference hall at the O2 dome in London, the lead administrator, Tony Lomas, told hundreds of representatives and lawyers that he had recovered about $5bn out of a potential $550bn of obligations owing to creditors. A further $22.3bn of client assets had been identified, all of which will be returned to their owners.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He drew a comparison with the US energy-trading group Enron, which collapsed in 2001, noting that some of his colleagues are still working on unresolved elements of that administration. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lomas said the administration was already behind schedule because of delays in receiving confirmation from third parties believed to be holding assets of Lehman Brothers International (Europe).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The balance sheet position will be north of $1tn and we've got a long way to go before knowing what the position is for creditors," Lomas said after the meeting. "The prospect is that some creditors will lose money. How much? We can't determine that for a significant time."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;PWC has already identified more than 400 trade creditors to Lehman's European business, including Reuters, HSBC, Hewlett-Packard, BT, the London Stock Exchange and Lufthansa. Even PWC itself is listed among those owed money by the collapsed firm, as are the Bank of England and the Financial Services Authority. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The parent company Lehman Brothers Holdings, once America's fourth-largest bank, was forced to file for bankruptcy protection in the US in September after investors lost confidence in the business and the quality of assets on its balance sheet. It had been one of the most active players in sub-prime home lending.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The settlement of Lehman credit insurance contracts linked to the bank's bonds suggested debt holders could expect to recover less than nine cents in the dollar.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;About 1,500 Lehman staff in Europe lost their jobs or resigned as the bank went bust. A further 2,500, mainly at the group's Canary Wharf offices, became employees of the Japanese bank Nomura, which bought the European and Middle Eastern equities and investment banking operations out of administration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div style="float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/lehmanbrothers"&gt;Lehman Brothers&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/useconomy"&gt;US economy&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/banking"&gt;UK banking sector&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk"&gt;guardian.co.uk&lt;/a&gt; &amp;copy; Guardian News &amp; Media Limited 2008 | Use of this content is subject to our &lt;a href="http://users.guardian.co.uk/help/article/0,,933909,00.html"&gt;Terms &amp; Conditions&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/webfeeds/1,,1309488,00.html"&gt;More Feeds&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>Kevin Rushby takes a walk through what will soon be Scotland's coast-to-coast forest</title>
      <link>http://www.guardian.co.uk/travel/2008/nov/15/scotland-woodland-glen-affric</link>
      <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="http://hits.guardian.co.uk/b/ss/guardiangu-feeds/1/H.15.1/5989?ns=guardian&amp;pageName=Travel%3A+Return+of+the+natives&amp;ch=Travel&amp;c3=The+Guardian&amp;c4=Green+travel%2CScotland+%28Travel%29%2CWildlife+holidays%2CCamping%2CUnited+Kingdom+%28Travel%29%2CShort+breaks%2CTravel%2CWalking+%28Travel%29%2CHotels%2CWildlife+%28Environment%29%2CConservation+%28Environment%29%2CEnvironment&amp;c5=Environment+Conservation%2CGreen+Travel%2CNot+commercially+useful%2CEthical+Living%2CHotels%2CShort+Breaks+Travel%2COutdoor+and+Active%2CUK+Travel&amp;c6=Kevin+Rushby&amp;c7=2008_11_15&amp;c8=1117885&amp;c9=article&amp;c10=GU&amp;c11=Travel&amp;c12=Green+travel&amp;c13=&amp;c14=&amp;h2=GU%2FTravel%2FGreen+travel" width="1" height="1" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Standing near the head of Glen Affric as darkness falls, I listen to the creak of an old pine tree bending in the wind. There are few trees here, and those that do survive are twisted and stunted by the severity of weather conditions: it's only mid-October, but there is already plenty of snow on the ridges to add to the savage beauty of the valley. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The map labels much of this area as forest, but that is simply medieval nomenclature, a time when the word indicated a deer-hunting ground rather than trees. It is certainly not what we would call a forest now: most of the ground here is tussocks of heather and sphagnum mosses. My guide Gordon Birnie, however, points to some pale green feathery sprigs dotted among the heathers. "Scots Pines. These have self-seeded."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That makes it sound a random benefit, but it is not. The regeneration is part of a carefully orchestrated plan to join up existing patches of ancient forest. The net result for walkers is something very exciting indeed. Gordon waves his arm westwards. "Over there is a treeless stretch of two or three miles, and that is the last gap. When seedlings start growing there, there'll be forest right across Scotland."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We move on a few hundred metres more while the last of the light fades. The significance of this place is enormous: in some of the most spectacular landscapes that we have, ancient woodland will be augmented by new growth to create a forest spanning the country. Footpaths already thread through the woodland, linking the Moray Firth in the east to Kintail in the west. Accommodation exists, too, though in the wilder reaches of Glen Affric the choice is limited to the unstaffed youth hostel at Allt Beithe or a wild campsite of your own choosing (wild camping is legal in Scotland, see &lt;a href="http://www.mcofs.org.uk/home.asp"&gt;mcofs.org.uk/home.asp&lt;/a&gt; for details).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The time when Britain was last spanned by woods is a point of debate in academic circles. The Caledonian forest grew up after the last ice age ended, 10,000 years ago, and has been in decline for at least the last 2,000 years, but no one is sure how extensive that forest ever was. Some experts, like botanist Oliver Rackham, regard the idea of an ancient and vast Caledonian pine forest as something of a myth (see his fascinating book, Woodlands). Certainly, Bonnie Prince Charlie didn't find much cover as he fled westwards in 1746. Twenty-seven years later, when Dr Johnson lost his walking stick in the Highlands, he quipped to Boswell: "Consider, sir, the value of such a piece of timber here!" Whatever the truth about the past may be, the new Caledonian forest is certainly taking shape. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our day had started at the foot of the glen, a valley that runs a few miles north and parallel with the Great Glen and Loch Ness. In autumn this is one of Britain's finest sights: birch and aspen in golden clouds around the evergreen pines, while on the forest floor heathers still flower among the blaeberries and cowberries. Gordon, biologist-turned-walking-guide for adventure travel company Wilderness Scotland, was keen-eyed and informative, pointing out the star-like fingers of the moss polytrichum and the scarlet fruiting bodies of tiny lichens. The best views, I reckon, were to be had in the microcosms: down there in the great rugged reefs of mossy life were silvery coralline lichens, flattened green blooms, and powdery orange crusts. Perhaps, I thought, country walks should be accompanied by a magnifying glass, as well as binoculars.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We moved up to a knoll where the birches were laden with unkempt lichens, old men's beards that dripped gently into the heather. "After the last ice age," Gordon tells me, "there would have been wolves, bears, beavers and lynx living here." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Later on there were people, too: the Chisholm clan to be precise, who later went to America and made themselves famous with a cattle trail (the Chisholm Trail was named after Jesse Chisholm, son of a Glen Affric emigrant and a Cherokee woman). Ironically, the native people cleared from Scotland's wildernesses in the 18th century were, soon after, the same people who helped clear Native Americans from such sites as Yosemite and Yellowstone. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As we headed up the valley, there were fabulous views across the various lochs, and despite the changeable weather, several parties of photographers were out, hoping to capture what is one of the finest autumnal scenes in Britain. Gordon, being an expert with ice axe and crampons, likes it best in winter. "You have it to yourself," he says with a grin. "Though it is cold - I bring my two dogs and they sleep on my feet at night."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Higher up, the botany changes: the pines becoming more dominant and the vegetation hardier. The tiny insectivorous butterworts by the footpath are testament to the impoverished nature of the soil. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Much of the regeneration work up here has been led by Trees for Life, a charity set up in 1986 by the environmentalist Alan Watson Featherstone, whose views were profoundly moved by years spent in the Canadian wilderness. "When I came back to Scotland," he says, "I found some remnants of ancient forest, especially in Glen Affric, but even they were not in good health: trees were reaching the end of their lifespan and not being replaced because of over-grazing. I could see that we were the last generation that could save the forest."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He set out to do something about the problem, setting up Trees for Life which, so far, has planted 750,000 trees using a volunteer workforce. People come for a week in spring or autumn and live in simple bothies or chalets, a great way to spend time in a beautiful part of the country doing useful work. In 1992 Alan spotted an opportunity to join up patches of forest in Glen Affric, creating a wooded corridor right across the country, a vision now nearing completion. This year the charity also bought the 10,000-acre Dundreggan estate in neighbouring Glen Moriston, allowing the possibility of bringing other valleys into the project.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's a 250-year plan," he says, with a laugh. "The goal being to regenerate a forest that is a full ecosystem."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The implications of that are deep. Next year will see the first beavers reintroduced in Scotland, but other animals will need to follow. "Wild boar are very important," says Alan. "They eat bracken roots and turn the soil which helps Scots pine seeds find the right niche." He has also suggested that the wolf should be brought back, perhaps in 2043, 300 years, reputedly, after the last wild British wolf was shot near Findhorn.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At lunchtime our walk brings us to Dog Falls, a deep romantic chasm filled with a roaring torrent. There's a car park and explanatory signboards to help with visitors' "wilderness" experience. This is very much a man-made wilderness and the human presence cannot be forgotten: there is even a hydroelectric scheme, carefully tucked away in the trees. I wonder how the wolf will ever fit in. Actually, wolves are notoriously secretive, as is the lynx, and will probably do very well, if the sheep farmers can be persuaded to allow reintroduction. The real unknown factor in this wonderful, and newly emerging, wilderness is how the humans will fit in. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Walking back to the car in the gloaming, I pause for a few moments on the bank of a roaring stream. Gordon splashes onward and I am alone. How will attitudes to wilderness be in the 22nd century, I wonder, when the late-returning rambler stops for a second and hears, from deep in the thick dark Caledonian forest, the eerie howls of the wolf pack?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Way to go&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Getting there&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wilderness Scotland (0131-625 6635, &lt;a href="http://www.wildernessscotland.com"&gt;wildernessscotland.com&lt;/a&gt;) runs a five-day Walking in Glen Affric and the Great Glen trip for &amp;pound;625pp including accommodation with breakfasts and packed lunches, two evening meals, services of a guide and transport from Inverness.
