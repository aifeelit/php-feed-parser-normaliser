      <title>Gordon Brown heralds progress at G20 financial crisis talks</title>

The prime minister is pushing the idea of immediate and coordinated tax cuts – as well interest rate cuts - to prevent the global economy &lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/recession"&gt;sliding deeper into recession&lt;/a&gt;. The prime minister has argued that interest rate cuts alone are insufficient to stave off a slump and that the impact of tax cuts or higher public spending will be diluted if carried out by only a handful of countries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The US president, George Bush, agreed that progress had been made but said the crisis has not ended and much work needs to be done. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a radio address, the US president-elect, &lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/barackobama"&gt;Barack Obama&lt;/a&gt;, said he was pleased that George Bush had brought world leaders to Washington to discuss turmoil in the financial markets "because our global economic crisis requires a coordinated global response".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Washington summit, meant to be the first in a series, was arranged to discuss steps to deal with what policymakers describe as the worst economic crisis since the Great Depression in the 1930s. US retailers reported a record fall in sales last month and the chairman of the Federal Reserve, Ben Bernanke, hinted at another interest rate cut to encourage consumers to spend.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But even as world leaders met in what is the largest collection of presidents and prime ministers in almost a decade, doubts were raised that it would achieve anything beyond immediate moves to stimulate the world economy and an agreement to meet again.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Economists warned that hopes of a major push on creating new global regulatory systems would almost certainly be dashed. The meeting had been too hastily convened, was riven by too many internal contradictions and was too hampered by the power vacuum in Washington to achieve instant results. "I'm confident that not much concrete action will come out of it," said Brad Setser, a former US Treasury official and expert on geoeconomics at the Council on Foreign Relations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The fact that the gathering brings together representatives of about 85% of the world's economy has prompted inevitable comparisons to the 1944 Bretton Woods meeting when 44 countries gathered in New Hampshire to devise the postwar international monetary system. But most analysts believe that "Bretton Woods II" will resemble its predecessor only in the scale of the crisis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With US unemployment at its highest level in 25 years, the eurozone in recession and Chinese growth slowing, the challenges confronting the global economy are daunting. But the expectations are limited for what will emerge from five hours of discussions. Two years of work went into the original Bretton Woods, compared with a month of scrambled preparations for this summit. "There hasn't been enough preparatory work for this summit to come up with any systemic recommendations," said Dani Rodrik, a professor of economics at Harvard University.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Brown acknowledged disputes over how, and how fast, to reform international financial institutions such as the IMF and World Bank. "There are very different points of view about what should be done, different interests represented here, different policy positions," he said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the prime minister added that today's talks could see a breakthrough in the long-running &lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/dohatradetalks"&gt;Doha round of trade talks&lt;/a&gt; that have bogged down in an argument between rich and developing nations over access to markets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I am determined that the world economy is stronger, that we show leadership," Brown said. "When markets seize up and investors are not there, the only people who can show leadership to build confidence is governments and they must work together."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Brown also hit back at &lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/georgeosborne"&gt;George Osborne&lt;/a&gt;, the Tory shadow chancellor, who said government plans to borrow more risked a run on the pound.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I regret the partisan talk from the opposition," Brown told the BBC. "When other countries are coming together for a common purpose I think it is the duty of politicians to show responsibility and to show leadership."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div style="float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/economics"&gt;Economics&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/globaleconomy"&gt;Global economy&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/globalrecession"&gt;Global recession&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/worldbank"&gt;World Bank&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/economy"&gt;Economic policy&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk"&gt;guardian.co.uk&lt;/a&gt; &amp;copy; Guardian News &amp; Media Limited 2008 | Use of this content is subject to our &lt;a href="http://users.guardian.co.uk/help/article/0,,933909,00.html"&gt;Terms &amp; Conditions&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/webfeeds/1,,1309488,00.html"&gt;More Feeds&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>The G20: Who is there and how desperate are they?</title>
      <link>http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/2008/nov/15/economics-globaleconomy</link>
      <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="http://hits.guardian.co.uk/b/ss/guardiangu-feeds/1/H.15.1/68058?ns=guardian&amp;pageName=Business%3A+The+G20%3A+Who+is+there+and+how+desperate+are+they%3F&amp;ch=Business&amp;c3=The+Guardian&amp;c4=Economics+%28Business%29%2CGlobal+economy+%28Business%29%2CGlobal+recession%2CWorld+Bank+%28Business%29%2CEconomic+policy%2CPolitics%2CBusiness%2CUK+news%2CUS+news%2CWorld+news&amp;c5=Credit+Crunch%2CNot+commercially+useful%2CBusiness+Markets&amp;c6=Ed+Pilkington&amp;c7=2008_11_15&amp;c8=1118409&amp;c9=article&amp;c10=GU&amp;c11=Business&amp;c12=Economics&amp;c13=&amp;c14=&amp;h2=GU%2FBusiness%2FEconomics" width="1" height="1" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Argentina - $150bn public debt&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Attending:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner, president&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Argentina last month decided to nationalise its 10 largest private pension funds, taking $30bn of assets into public ownership. Shares then lost a fifth of their value in two days. Argentina defaulted on its debts in 2001 and investors fear it may do so again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Desperation rating:&lt;/strong&gt; Five stars&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Australia - $141bn public debt&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Kevin Rudd, prime minister&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Australia has eliminated net public debt but runs a gross one of about 15% of GDP. Tough regulation meant its banks had little exposure to the US subprime mortgage market but the fall in commodity prices is hurting. Australia could face recession next year. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Desperation rating: &lt;/strong&gt; Three stars&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Brazil - $590bn public debt&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, president&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Brazil's economy is growing at 5% this year but is expected to slow sharply next year. Central bank is making credit available to help firms boost sales and it has intervened in the market to meet demand for the US dollar.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Desperation rating:&lt;/strong&gt; Three stars&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Canada - $900bn public debt&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Stephen Harper, prime minister&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Bank of Canada warned that growth would hit zero next year. Weaker oil prices and lower US demand are hurting Canada. Last month, it guaranteed bank lending in a move that could leave the taxpayer liable for up to US$175bn.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Desperation rating: &lt;/strong&gt;Four stars&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;China - $580bn public debt&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hu Jintao, president&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;China is taking a big spending $586bn approach as industrial growth  hits a seven-year low. As holder of the world's largest foreign exchange reserves ($1,900bn) China is under pressure to aid global finances but stands to be the biggest winner from the crisis.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Desperation rating: &lt;/strong&gt; Three stars&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;France - $1.63tr public debt&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Nicolas Sarkozy, president&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The French economy grew by 0.1% between July and September but recession may only be temporarily avoided. Paris has made a &amp;euro;320bn guarantee for bank lending and a $40bn fund to recapitalise banks. Sarkozy has announced the creation of a fund to protect French companies from foreign "predators".&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Desperation rating:&lt;/strong&gt; Four stars&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Germany - $2.07tr public debt&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Angela Merkel, chancellor&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Europe's largest economy officially entered recession this week after GDP shrank by 0.5%, the second quarter of decline. Germany has seen exports plunge. It is providing &amp;euro;400bn in guarantees for bank lending, plus a further &amp;euro;100bn to recapitalise its banks. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Desperation rating:&lt;/strong&gt; Four stars&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;India - $637bn public debt&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Manmohan Singh, prime minister&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;India is being tipped as a key player in helping bolster the global economy. Growth is expected to be 7.5% this year, down from 9% and disguising the slowdown in the industrial sector. Along with China, a big gainer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Desperation rating:&lt;/strong&gt; One star &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Indonesia - $147bn public debt&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono, president&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jakarta unveiled an emergency package last month in response to increasing pressure on its currency and stock market - including export tax cuts and ordering state-owned companies to repatriate foreign currency earnings. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Desperation rating: &lt;/strong&gt;Two stars&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Italy - $2.19tr public debt&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Silvio Berlusconi, prime minister&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The economy has contracted for a second quarter, by a worse than expected 0.5%. It is Italy's fourth recession in seven years. The government has set aside up to &amp;euro;40bn to recapitalise its banks and created a &amp;euro;650m fund to guarantee lending to companies.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Desperation rating: &lt;/strong&gt; Five stars&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Japan - $7.45tr public debt&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Taro Aso, prime minister&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The world's second biggest economy may be on the brink of recession. Despite this, Japan is prepared to take a leading role in helping get the global economy going, standing ready to offer $100bn in loans.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Desperation rating: &lt;/strong&gt; Three stars&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Mexico - $203bn public debt&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Felipe de Jesus Calderon Hinojosa, president&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The government is increasing spending by more than 13% to $231bn next year in a bid to boost the economy. The slump in the oil price hurt Mexico as oil revenues finance around 40% of its spending. The US slump has also cut the amount expatriate Mexicans send home.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Desperation rating: &lt;/strong&gt; Four stars&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Russia - $76bn public debt&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dmitry Medvedev, president&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Russia has pledged a $200bn package for the economy and financial markets while the central bank has raised key interest rates to try to halt capital flight. Share prices have slumped while the rouble has been under heavy pressure. Russia has financial firepower but a fall in commodity prices hurts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Desperation rating: &lt;/strong&gt;Four stars &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Saudi Arabia - $91bn public debt&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;King Abdullah&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Its stock market is down 40% this year and the government has made $40bn available to its banks. However, the focus has been on Saudi pumping money into the IMF so that it can in turn bail out struggling countries. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Desperation rating: &lt;/strong&gt; Three stars&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;South Africa - $88bn public debt&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Petrus Kgalema Motlanthe, president&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Its financial system is largely unscathed and could use its stronger bargaining position to press for more African voices in international forums such as the IMF. A potential gainer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Desperation rating: &lt;/strong&gt; Two stars&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;South Korea - $269bn public debt&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lee Myung-bak, president&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No bank nationalisations but the government said yesterday it was ready to provide liquidity to the sector amid fears of mounting bad debts and slowing growth. Wobbling. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Desperation rating: &lt;/strong&gt; Three stars&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Turkey - $257bn public debt&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tayyip Recep Erdogan, prime minister&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Turkey's debt was downgraded by credit rating agencies this week. It might need further IMF cash. Its currency lost a third of its value against the dollar last month alone. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Desperation rating: &lt;/strong&gt; Four stars&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;UK - $1.2tr public debt&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Gordon Brown, prime minister&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Amid bank bail-outs and interest rate cuts the country sits on the brink of recession. The FTSE has lost around 40% since last summer. &lt;strong&gt;Desperation rating: &lt;/strong&gt; Five stars&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;US - $8.4tr public debt&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;George Bush, president&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The origin of the subprime crisis. Washington has drawn up a $700bn bail-out plan for the nation's banks, including a fund to buy toxic assets. Needs a solution fast. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Desperation rating: &lt;/strong&gt; Five stars&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;EU&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The eurozone is now officially in recession. The economy of the 15 countries using the euro shrank by 0.2% between July and September compared with the previous quarter. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Desperation rating: &lt;/strong&gt;Four stars&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div style="float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/economics"&gt;Economics&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/globaleconomy"&gt;Global economy&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/globalrecession"&gt;Global recession&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/worldbank"&gt;World Bank&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/economy"&gt;Economic policy&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/usa"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk"&gt;guardian.co.uk&lt;/a&gt; &amp;copy; Guardian News &amp; Media Limited 2008 | Use of this content is subject to our &lt;a href="http://users.guardian.co.uk/help/article/0,,933909,00.html"&gt;Terms &amp; Conditions&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/webfeeds/1,,1309488,00.html"&gt;More Feeds&lt;/a&gt;</description>

The meeting had been too hastily convened, was riven by too many internal contradictions and was too hampered by the power vacuum in Washington to achieve instant results. "I'm confident that not much concrete action will come out of it," said Brad Setser, a former US Treasury official and expert on geoeconomics at the Council on Foreign Relations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The fact that the gathering brings together representatives of about 85% of the world's economy has prompted inevitable comparisons to the 1944 Bretton Woods meeting when 44 countries gathered in New Hampshire to devise the postwar international monetary system. But most analysts believe that "Bretton Woods II" will resemble its predecessor only in the scale of the crisis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With US unemployment at its highest level in 25 years, the eurozone in recession and Chinese growth slowing, the challenges confronting the global economy are daunting. But the expectations are limited for what will emerge from those five hours of discussions. Two years of work went into the original Bretton Woods, compared with a month of scrambled preparations for this summit. "There hasn't been enough preparatory work for this summit to come up with any systemic recommendations," said Dani Rodrik, a professor of economics at Harvard University.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The summit was convened at the request of the French president, Nicolas Sarkozy, backed by Gordon Brown, and extended by George Bush beyond the usual parameters of the G8 to include a much wider spectrum in recognition of the global nature of the economic crisis. Its participants include the US, the EU and Japan as well as emerging economies - China, India, Russia and Brazil.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Expectations are low partly as a result of the vacuum at the summit's centre, a product of the lame duck nature of US government. Barack Obama, the president-elect, will be notable by his absence, though he sent two envoys. "That's a problem. The world needs strong and immediate leadership," Rodrik said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The disparate nature of the group also brings potential problems. Bush has made it clear that while the US may favour greater regulation, it should be handled at the national rather than international level. China, too, has shown little desire to see new global systems reduce its control over its own exchange rate. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The Chinese exchange rate is fundamentally undervalued, but the Chinese government sees that as a matter of its own sovereignty," said Setser.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With those caveats, most analysts believe that the best result that can be hoped for from the summit would be collective action to stimulate the global economy. In addition, there may be a common statement on the need to avoid any defensive moves towards protectionism in either trade or financial markets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The UN secretary-general, Ban Ki-moon, will be present, along with the heads of the World Bank and International Monetary Fund (IMF). Their priority is likely to be to shield developing countries from the downturn, and they will be looking for commitments from leaders for help to prevent the crisis spilling over into emerging markets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ban has warned in an open letter to the summit that a human tragedy could unfold. "If hundreds of millions of people lose their livelihoods and their hopes for the future are dashed because of a crisis they have absolutely no responsibility for, the human crisis will not remain just economic," he wrote.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The prime minister of Japan, Taro Aso, has also spoken about the impact on poorer countries. He has offered to lend the IMF up to $100bn (&amp;pound;67.4bn), and has asked other leaders to follow his example.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The big question hanging over the gathering will be how it seeks to pursue the pressing demand for regulatory reform after the participants have returned home. A consensus is building that existing global systems, that allowed a massive boom in house prices and lending to take place in several key economies, are outdated. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Possible areas of reform include the need for more unified accounting rules, greater cooperation between national regulators, better early warning systems and a more centralised approach to new financial wizardry that has been poorly understood and largely unregulated. Further talks will almost certainly take place after January 20, by which time a new US administration will be in place.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div style="float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/economics"&gt;Economics&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/globaleconomy"&gt;Global economy&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/globalrecession"&gt;Global recession&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/worldbank"&gt;World Bank&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/economy"&gt;Economic policy&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk"&gt;guardian.co.uk&lt;/a&gt; &amp;copy; Guardian News &amp; Media Limited 2008 | Use of this content is subject to our &lt;a href="http://users.guardian.co.uk/help/article/0,,933909,00.html"&gt;Terms &amp; Conditions&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/webfeeds/1,,1309488,00.html"&gt;More Feeds&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>Alarm bells ring in the Square Mile as RBS culls 3,000 jobs</title>
      <link>http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/2008/nov/15/royal-bank-of-scotland-group-banking</link>
      <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="http://hits.guardian.co.uk/b/ss/guardiangu-feeds/1/H.15.1/42500?ns=guardian&amp;pageName=Business%3A+Alarm+bells+ring+in+the+Square+Mile+as+RBS+culls+3%2C000+jobs&amp;ch=Business&amp;c3=The+Guardian&amp;c4=Royal+Bank+of+Scotland+%28Business%29%2CBanking+sector+%28Business%29%2CRecession+%28UK%29%2CBanks+and+building+societies%2CBusiness%2CMoney%2CUK+news&amp;c5=Personal+Finance%2CInvestments%2CCredit+Crunch%2CNot+commercially+useful%2CBusiness+Markets&amp;c6=Phillip+Inman&amp;c7=2008_11_15&amp;c8=1118380&amp;c9=article&amp;c10=GU&amp;c11=Business&amp;c12=Royal+Bank+of+Scotland&amp;c13=&amp;c14=&amp;h2=GU%2FBusiness%2FRoyal+Bank+of+Scotland" width="1" height="1" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Royal Bank of Scotland is finalising plans to cut 3,000 jobs in its investment banking business in a move that will send shivers through London's Square Mile. The bank, which is receiving a &amp;pound;20bn handout from the government, expects to brief staff in the next couple of weeks about the cull, which could trigger further job losses in businesses that rely on the bank.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;More than 10,000 jobs are expected to go at Citigroup, the US bank which has 12,000 staff in the UK, with 350 jobs at Clydesdale and Yorkshire banks. New Star, the City fund manager that counts Lakshmi Mittal, the billionaire steel magnate, among its clients, said it was shedding 50 to 60 jobs from a workforce of 370. The mounting job losses dampened an early rise in shares in London and pushed Wall Street lower, reflecting increasing gloom that the economies of over-indebted western nations would struggle in the short term.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; MPs have become increasingly agitated about job losses in their constituencies over the coming months and the potential electoral backlash. John McFall, Labour MP for West Dunbartonshire and chairman of the Treasury select committee, urged RBS to protect its 170,000 staff, 100,000 of whom are in the UK, and the bank's Gogarburn headquarters on the outskirts of Edinburgh, from the cuts. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The headquarters of RBS in Scotland are a symbol of the investment that the company has made in Gogarburn. This must be illustrated by their decision." RBS insiders indicated the axe would fall on staff in its global banking and markets division, badly hit by the slowdown in trading in exotic derivatives after the credit crunch.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;RBS, like many other banks, had also become involved in raising capital for foreign companies and lending money for takeovers. These deals have largely dried up since last summer when the credit squeeze began. RBS would not officially confirm that 3,000 jobs are being cut. "We constantly review our operating model to make sure it is appropriate to the market condition," said a spokesman.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div style="float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/royalbankofscotlandgroup"&gt;Royal Bank of Scotland&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/banking"&gt;UK banking sector&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/recession"&gt;Recession&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/money/banks"&gt;Banks and building societies&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk"&gt;guardian.co.uk&lt;/a&gt; &amp;copy; Guardian News &amp; Media Limited 2008 | Use of this content is subject to our &lt;a href="http://users.guardian.co.uk/help/article/0,,933909,00.html"&gt;Terms &amp; Conditions&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/webfeeds/1,,1309488,00.html"&gt;More Feeds&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>Construction workers bear brunt of pre-Christmas downturn</title>
      <link>http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/2008/nov/15/construction-redundancy</link>
      <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="http://hits.guardian.co.uk/b/ss/guardiangu-feeds/1/H.15.1/76645?ns=guardian&amp;pageName=Business%3A+Construction+workers+bear+brunt+of+pre-Christmas+downturn&amp;ch=Business&amp;c3=The+Guardian&amp;c4=Construction+industry+%28Business%29%2CBusiness%2CRedundancy%2CRecession+%28UK%29%2CMoney%2CUK+news&amp;c5=Personal+Finance%2CCredit+Crunch%2CNot+commercially+useful%2CBusiness+Markets&amp;c6=Jo+Adetunji%2CKathryn+Hopkins%2CMark+Milner&amp;c7=2008_11_15&amp;c8=1118372&amp;c9=article&amp;c10=GU&amp;c11=Business&amp;c12=Construction+industry&amp;c13=&amp;c14=&amp;h2=GU%2FBusiness%2FConstruction+industry" width="1" height="1" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Case study 1: Colin Patten, process controller, Cemex cement plant&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The clouds that followed the sunshine over the Cemex cement plant in Cambridgeshire echoed the news that 87 employees face redundancy as a result of the firm's decision to close the plant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"There's been a lack of building and a newer plant at Rugby, so it was always on the cards," said Colin Patten, 48, who joined the factory in 1985. "I got a call off my mate telling me that I was being made redundant. He was at a meeting management called where they said tell your mates as it would be better from them than on the news."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Patten, who lives in the nearby village of Barrington, said workers had been told they would keep working the six to six shift milling cement until stocks were used up and the factory closed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Everyone's stuck for words. I live in a council house and my two children have grown up, but some people are in a worse situation and have mortgages and things. The majority of the workforce has been there 20 years-plus and that's all they've done. The village has been built around the factory, which has been here for 80 years. I've worked there for 23 and feel like I've had the rug pulled from underneath me. I'm gutted."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Patten said some people - half a dozen or so - were coming up for retirement but others, like him, would have to retrain to find another job. "There's nothing else like it around here. I'm going to have to cut back this Christmas. One or two people are going to be happy because there'll be fewer lorries, but that doesn't get jobs does it? Other villages all have people who work there."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A spokesman for Cemex said it would work out redundancy packages during the consultation with unions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Case study 2: Joe Cunningham, builder, Doncaster&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Joe Cunningham, 44, has been struggling to find a job after being made redundant by Midlands-based home builder David Wilson Homes. He has signed on at the Jobcentre and has been desperately sending out copies of his CV so he can support his family throughout the Christmas period. "I'm not going to stand still," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He has struggled to find building work as most construction firms have scaled down their operations. After one job was finished, he would just walk on to another building site and be given work immediately, but he cannot do that anymore as most of the sites are caged up. He said: "The construction industry was the first hit. A lot of big employers are making cuts: I read about JCB making cuts just this morning. It's easy to hire and fire. It costs nothing."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He has applied for a job teaching bricklaying skills in a prison and is in the final stages of the interview process. But his former colleagues have been less fortunate. "They haven't got anything," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cunningham has two children, aged 15 and 11. They are "good kids", he said, who understand they will have fewer presents this Christmas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Case study 3: Stephen Gregory, former Rover worker, West Midlands&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For 16 years, Stephen Gregory, 47, worked in the engine plant at MG Rover's Longbridge site in the West Midlands, until its closure in 2005. He was offered training and, with little idea what he wanted to do, accepted a course in lorry driving. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gregory qualified and got a job but he "hated it". He then retrained, at his own expense, as a driving instructor and is self-employed. Is it better? "It is, in some ways. I'm my own boss and can set my hours to suit myself. But when you worked at Rover you could clock on, do the day's work and finish. You didn't have to worry about doing your own tax or national insurance. I'm no better off than when I worked at Longbridge."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What advice does he have for someone who has been made redundant. "Don't rush into anything. I think that was my problem. When you don't know how long you're going to be out of work, you grab the first thing that comes along. My advice is to look carefully."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div style="float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/construction"&gt;Construction industry&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/money/redundancy"&gt;Redundancy&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/recession"&gt;Recession&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk"&gt;guardian.co.uk&lt;/a&gt; &amp;copy; Guardian News &amp; Media Limited 2008 | Use of this content is subject to our &lt;a href="http://users.guardian.co.uk/help/article/0,,933909,00.html"&gt;Terms &amp; Conditions&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/webfeeds/1,,1309488,00.html"&gt;More Feeds&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>'It's our Queen Vic, we find out what's going on there'</title>

      <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="http://hits.guardian.co.uk/b/ss/guardiangu-feeds/1/H.15.1/84687?ns=guardian&amp;pageName=UK+news%3A+%27It%27s+our+Queen+Vic%2C+we+find+out+what%27s+going+on+there%27&amp;ch=UK+news&amp;c3=The+Guardian&amp;c4=Postal+service%2CScotland+%28News%29%2CCommunities+%28Society%29%2CRural+affairs%2CUK+news%2CPolitics%2CWelfare+%28Politics%29%2CSociety&amp;c5=Society+Weekly%2CNot+commercially+useful%2CSocial+Care+Society%2CCommunities+Society&amp;c6=Severin+Carrell&amp;c7=2008_11_15&amp;c8=1118371&amp;c9=article&amp;c10=GU&amp;c11=UK+news&amp;c12=Postal+service&amp;c13=&amp;c14=&amp;h2=GU%2FUK+news%2FPostal+service" width="1" height="1" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Morebattle is a village in crisis. Its small post office will soon close and the locals are furious. Once that goes, so too will the shop it is housed in. Yet the store is at the very centre of Morebattle life, said Andrew McEwan, a local councillor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The shop can't survive on its own; they're going to kill off the shop and that will kill off the village," he said. "It's like the Queen Vic of the village. It's where people go to find out what's going on."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A crowd of residents - mostly pensioners - cluster near the counter in the shop-cum-post office in the tiny Borders village. One of at least 2,500 post office branches earmarked for closure nationwide, it is the only subject of conversation. "We think it stinks," said Matilda Hall, who has written to the prime minister Gordon Brown four times to complain. "We think the whole thing is unjust, unfair and extremely badly managed; highly undemocratic." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is a community of 500 people, a neat settlement of old terraced cottages, converted workshops and weathered stone villas.  But the shop is the last in the village. The butcher's closed this summer, as did the GP's surgery. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Village Store is an all-purpose business. Owned by Vanessa Burke, it collects prescriptions brought  by courier from Kelso, eight miles away; it keeps the local bus timetable and sells groceries. But the shop and post office must support each other in order to survive. Burke, who manages the post office,  is running down the stock "I think everyone is in a state of shock," she said. "They still don't believe it."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Morebattle was chosen for closure after assessors said there were too few customers to justify the cost of maintaining it. Villagers will have to travel to Kelso between the twice-weekly mobile post office service that will be based in Morebattle's only pub, The Temple Hall Hotel. But the pub, too, is up for sale.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Residents have accused the Post Office of cynicism. They believe their branch has slowly been  stripped of its more profitable  services, such as car tax  and family benefits.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Brenda Herdman, 77, said:  "It's the hub of the village ... There will be nothing left here. It's going to be a disaster."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div style="float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/post"&gt;Postal service&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/scotland"&gt;Scotland&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/society/communities"&gt;Communities&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/ruralaffairs"&gt;Rural affairs&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/welfare"&gt;Welfare&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk"&gt;guardian.co.uk&lt;/a&gt; &amp;copy; Guardian News &amp; Media Limited 2008 | Use of this content is subject to our &lt;a href="http://users.guardian.co.uk/help/article/0,,933909,00.html"&gt;Terms &amp; Conditions&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/webfeeds/1,,1309488,00.html"&gt;More Feeds&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>Post office: 'For us, it's the centre of life in our community'</title>
      <link>http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/2008/nov/15/post-office-rural-affairs-government1</link>
      <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="http://hits.guardian.co.uk/b/ss/guardiangu-feeds/1/H.15.1/66572?ns=guardian&amp;pageName=UK+news%3A+%27For+us%2C+it%27s+the+centre+of+life+in+our+community%27&amp;ch=UK+news&amp;c3=The+Guardian&amp;c4=Postal+service%2CRural+affairs%2CUK+news%2CWelfare+%28Politics%29%2CPolitics&amp;c5=Not+commercially+useful%2CSocial+Care+Society&amp;c6=Martin+Wainwright&amp;c7=2008_11_15&amp;c8=1118370&amp;c9=article&amp;c10=GU&amp;c11=UK+news&amp;c12=Postal+service&amp;c13=&amp;c14=&amp;h2=GU%2FUK+news%2FPostal+service" width="1" height="1" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's a rainy day in Harrogate, but Cold Bath Road post office is heaving. "This is actually quiet for us," says John Moretta as the postman hauls a fourth pair of parcel-crammed bags into his van. "We're thinking of installing a third counter window."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Everyone in this part of town seems to need stamps today, pensions, or checks on the size/weight conundrum of packages too thick for the Royal Mail template's "small letter" slit. "Our daily footfall is over 1,000 customers," adds Moretta.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unlike the Soviet/Austerity type of sub-post office, which has a feeble range of other goods, Cold Bath Road is packed with stationery, confectionery, magazines and newspapers. And it opens at 5.30am.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I've come to send a company letter," says Jeanette Peak, first in the queue for the tills. "I'm a sales consultant for a Leeds firm which sells educational programmes and I've a lot of this sort of correspondence. But I'm also here because it's convenient for getting my newspapers."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She's got other Post Office benefits on her list including foreign exchange - Moretta's partner, Chris Ford, the sub-postmistress, can get any currency she's asked for within 24 hours. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We've four collections of post a day," says Ford, whose counters were saved this year after one of the feistiest campaigns the Post Office has seen. "Today's what you call a general pensions day, which is where the Post Office card is so important. The news that we're keeping it has given us a big lift."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Next in line is Anthony Spencer, posting a jumbo bag of parcels for eBay. He says: "I come here every day for my daughter, who's closed down her business and is selling off her stock."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Patrick Procter, who runs a marketing agency, is another eBay customer, with a long cylindrical parcel for a client in Wales. "Orders on eBay are what brings me in mostly," he says, "but I've done insurance, too, and holiday money."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Squawks from one-year-old Eliza House introduce another customer, her mother, Anne. She values the Post Office more widely. "The Post Office gets us all out talking to each other," she says. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Diana Howard, who had been chatting to Mrs House, agrees. "I'm glad about the card staying as I use it for my pension," she says. "But this goes much deeper. I want post offices to survive because they're the centre of the life of our community."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Noting that Cold Bath Road has had a post office since 1896, Moretta agrees. "Trade has gone up by 20% since we won our battle in February. And you know who's getting a share of the profits."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div style="float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/post"&gt;Postal service&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/ruralaffairs"&gt;Rural affairs&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/welfare"&gt;Welfare&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk"&gt;guardian.co.uk&lt;/a&gt; &amp;copy; Guardian News &amp; Media Limited 2008 | Use of this content is subject to our &lt;a href="http://users.guardian.co.uk/help/article/0,,933909,00.html"&gt;Terms &amp; Conditions&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/webfeeds/1,,1309488,00.html"&gt;More Feeds&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>Ministers look to widen role of post offices</title>
      <link>http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/2008/nov/15/post-office-rural-affairs-government</link>
      <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="http://hits.guardian.co.uk/b/ss/guardiangu-feeds/1/H.15.1/63692?ns=guardian&amp;pageName=UK+news%3A+Ministers+look+to+widen+role+of+post+offices&amp;ch=UK+news&amp;c3=The+Guardian&amp;c4=Postal+service%2CRural+affairs%2CUK+news%2CWelfare+%28Politics%29%2CPolitics&amp;c5=Not+commercially+useful%2CSocial+Care+Society&amp;c6=Patrick+Wintour&amp;c7=2008_11_15&amp;c8=1118369&amp;c9=article&amp;c10=GU&amp;c11=UK+news&amp;c12=Postal+service&amp;c13=&amp;c14=&amp;h2=GU%2FUK+news%2FPostal+service" width="1" height="1" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ministers are to hold a series of meetings with Labour and Tory backbenchers to discuss what extra services the Post Office network could provide, including helping credit unions, dealing with payment of energy bills and the provision of identity-card services. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They are also expected to dust down a Cabinet Office report into potential future services for the Post Office. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The move follows the government's surprise decision this week to scrap the competitive tendering process for the post office card account this week, lifting the threat of closure of a further 3,000 post office branches, due to the threatened loss of the contract to supply benefits and pensions to about 4 million customers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The decision does not prevent the Post Office pressing ahead with its near-complete wave of 2,500 closures created by the Post Office network change programme,  aimed at stemming losses of &amp;pound;500,000 a day. But there is a mood in government, articulated in a letter from Lord Mandelson to Gordon Brown this week, that the remaining 11,5000 post offices could have an enhanced role at a time when the public are losing faith in banks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some backbenchers have talked of the Post Office becoming a people's bank, but different backbenchers have different expectations as to what that would mean. The idea of expanding financial services in the Post Office was highlighted in a 2006 report by the business and enterprise department, which spoke of the possibility of providing travel and car insurance. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is also pointed out that until the sale of the National Girobank to Alliance &amp; Leicester, the Post Office had the functions of a People's Bank. Arguably, with the contraction of the number of big banks, and the general public disdain for them, the Post Office could yet find a niche. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lord Mandelson and the business minister, Pat McFadden, have formed an unlikely alliance with the Communication Workers Union and leftwing backbenchers such as Jon Cruddas to discuss widening the scope of business at post office counters, including directing more government business through the Post Office.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At present, 78% of Department for Work and Pensions business goes through mainstream bank accounts, 20% into post office card accounts and about 2% are paid by Giro. There will also be discussions with local authorities to see if there is any mileage in the Post Office forging closer relations with local government, an idea that has been promoted for nearly 18 months by Kent County Council , but has so far led to only two post offices being reopened or kept alive. The Local Government Association has complained it has not had sufficient information from the Post Office on the viability of individual branches. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The CWU has claimed that an enhanced Post Office could ensure that basic service charges the poor pay are reduced directly by allowing service debits.  Energy and telecoms companies charge customers money for not using direct debits.  A publication by the Save the Children/The Family Welfare Association, estimated that financially excluded and low-income families pay an additional &amp;pound;1,000 a year as a result.   &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cruddas and other backbenchers, such as Kerry McCarthy, have suggested "the People's Bank could also become a vehicle for promoting micro-credit startups".  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mandelson has said he would set up a interdepartmental look at the network's new areas of service, but he would also have to decide how to respond to the wide-ranging review of the Royal Mail prepared for government by Richard Hooper, the former post-comms regulator. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It has been suggested this report would propose joint Royal Mail ventures with the private sector. Mandelson said it would publish its finding within the next few weeks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div style="float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/post"&gt;Postal service&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/ruralaffairs"&gt;Rural affairs&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/welfare"&gt;Welfare&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk"&gt;guardian.co.uk&lt;/a&gt; &amp;copy; Guardian News &amp; Media Limited 2008 | Use of this content is subject to our &lt;a href="http://users.guardian.co.uk/help/article/0,,933909,00.html"&gt;Terms &amp; Conditions&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/webfeeds/1,,1309488,00.html"&gt;More Feeds&lt;/a&gt;</description>

      <title>Marine was killed by fire from US jet during Taliban ambush</title>
      <link>http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/2008/nov/15/military-afghanistan</link>
      <description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="http://hits.guardian.co.uk/b/ss/guardiangu-feeds/1/H.15.1/46172?ns=guardian&amp;pageName=UK+news%3A+Marine+was+killed+by+fire+from+US+jet+during+Taliban+ambush&amp;ch=UK+news&amp;c3=The+Guardian&amp;c4=Military+UK%2CUK+news%2CAfghanistan+%28News%29%2CUS+news%2CWorld+news&amp;c5=Not+commercially+useful&amp;c6=David+Pallister%2CRichard+Norton-Taylor&amp;c7=2008_11_15&amp;c8=1118366&amp;c9=article&amp;c10=GU&amp;c11=UK+news&amp;c12=Military&amp;c13=&amp;c14=&amp;h2=GU%2FUK+news%2FMilitary" width="1" height="1" /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;A Royal Marine commando was killed by friendly fire from a US navy jet in the midst of a ferocious Taliban ambush during which both the pilot and his British ground controller bypassed official procedures, a board of inquiry concluded yesterday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jonathan Wigley, 21, was fatally wounded on December 5 2006 during a fierce battle with Taliban fighters near Garmsir in Helmand province, southern Afghanistan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The navy board of inquiry was published as two marines killed by a roadside bomb on Wednesday while on a patrol in their Jackal armoured vehicle were named as Robert "Frank" McKibben, 32, from County Mayo in the Irish Republic and Neil Dunstan, also 32, from Bournemouth. They died at the scene near Garmsir where the marines have been fighting the Taliban since their first deployment more than two years ago. A third marine was seriously injured.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The board of inquiry into Wigley's death said the pilot of the American F18 navy jet relied on his visual sighting rather than the aircraft's instruments. His ground controller did not adapt his procedures even though he could not see the plane because of the "weight of enemy fire".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The controller, "unaware of the geographic similarities between the enemy and friendly force positions, anticipated that having attacked the target successfully three times [the pilot] knew where it was and could identify it again", the board of inquiry said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The inquiry concluded: "Both acted in the best of intentions under very challenging conditions. The friendly fire incident was a tragic incident, which occurred in a highly-charged environment where lives were at risk." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The "most telling" statement in the inquiry came from Wigley's company sergeant major who had wanted to send a message to the aircrew of the flight after the incident. "This was never actually sent but it was going to say that it had not been a good day at the office for any of them but, had the F18s not been there, they would probably have lost far more men that day," the board's report said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both marines killed on Wednesday were trained as reconnaissance experts and were graduates with 42 Commando based in Plymouth, the MoD said. Dunstan had a degree in French and tourism and McKibben one in environmental science.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dunstan was due to marry in 2010. His fiancee, Kate Miller, said: "Neil was so proud to be a marine and lived each day to the full. He was my soulmate and the love of my life."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From the small town of Westport on the west coast of Ireland, the family of McKibben said: "We are all extremely proud of our Robbie. He had very definite plans of how he wanted to live his life; he was always thoughtful, considerate and had an amazing sense of humour ... He was so full of life and was loved so much by his family and by all his friends."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The men's commanding officer, Lieutenant Colonel Andrew McInerney, described McKibben as "an immensely capable man, yet his humility made him an example and inspiration to all he served with. A true commando - tough, unassuming and hugely convivial, he viewed life as a glass half-full. Regardless of the task or conditions, his 'can-do' attitude helped him and others overcome every test they encountered".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;McInerney said Dunstan "possessed commando qualities in abundance. His quiet confidence and humility was an inspiration to all those who worked with him. A quiet but natural leader, his maturity and intellect made him a valued role model and mentor".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div style="float: left; margin-right: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px;"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/military"&gt;Military&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/afghanistan"&gt;Afghanistan&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/usa"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk"&gt;guardian.co.uk&lt;/a&gt; &amp;copy; Guardian News &amp; Media Limited 2008 | Use of this content is subject to our &lt;a href="http://users.guardian.co.uk/help/article/0,,933909,00.html"&gt;Terms &amp; Conditions&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/webfeeds/1,,1309488,00.html"&gt;More Feeds&lt;/a&gt;</description>
